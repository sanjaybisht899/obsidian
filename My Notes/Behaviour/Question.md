Why should we hire you

I think I meet all the requirements of the job and I also feel that I have done well in the hiring and interview process. Hence, I am a good fit for the role.

You shouldn't hire me if you are simply looking for someone who writes a code without understanding the behavioural changes of code and its relevance for large scale applications, who is just there to add something without getting the end to end insights of the requirement, asked by lead to do. As, I'm someone who looks at bigger picture by considering best algorithm, appropriate inbuilt method selection, minute things that incorporating in the code.

I may not be a good hire if you are looking for someone to get the task done as per given directions blindly. I appreciate alternative thinking and exploring different effective ways of doing things and value innovation and constructive discussion for the betterment and greater good of the organization
