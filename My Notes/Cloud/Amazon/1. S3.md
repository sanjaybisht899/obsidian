### **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)**

Amazon S3 is a scalable object storage service used to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the internet. It is widely used for backup, data archiving, and serving static content.

---

### **1. Key Features**

âœ… **Object Storage** â€“ Stores data as objects in buckets, not as files in a file system.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Can handle unlimited data storage.  
âœ… **Durability** â€“ 99.999999999% (11 nines) durability ensures data is never lost.  
âœ… **Availability** â€“ High availability with automatic replication across multiple AZs.  
âœ… **Security** â€“ Supports encryption, IAM policies, and bucket policies for access control.  
âœ… **Versioning** â€“ Keeps multiple versions of an object to prevent accidental deletion.  
âœ… **Lifecycle Policies** â€“ Automates movement of objects between storage classes (Standard, IA, Glacier).  
âœ… **Event Notifications** â€“ Can trigger AWS Lambda, SNS, or SQS when objects are added/deleted.  
âœ… **Cost-effective** â€“ Pay only for what you use; cheaper storage tiers available.

### **Connecting Java Spring Boot with Amazon S3**

#### **1. Add AWS SDK Dependency**

Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>software.amazon.awssdk</groupId>
    <artifactId>s3</artifactId>
    <version>2.20.10</version>
</dependency>
```

#### **2. Configure AWS Credentials**

Set up using **AWS CLI** (`aws configure`) or in `application.properties`:

```
aws.accessKey=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY  
aws.secretKey=YOUR_SECRET_KEY  
aws.region=us-east-1  
aws.s3.bucketName=my-bucket-name  
```

#### **3. Create S3 Service**

```java
S3Client s3Client = S3Client.builder()
    .region(Region.US_EAST_1)
    .credentialsProvider(StaticCredentialsProvider.create(
        AwsBasicCredentials.create("YOUR_ACCESS_KEY", "YOUR_SECRET_KEY")))
    .build();

public String uploadFile(String filePath, String keyName) {
    s3Client.putObject(PutObjectRequest.builder().bucket(bucketName).key(keyName).build(), Paths.get(filePath));
    return s3Client.utilities().getUrl(GetUrlRequest.builder().bucket(bucketName).key(keyName).build()).toString();
}
```

#### **4. API Controller for Uploading Files**

```java
@PostMapping("/upload")
public String uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
    Path tempFile = Files.createTempFile("upload-", file.getOriginalFilename());
    Files.copy(file.getInputStream(), tempFile, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);
    return s3Service.uploadFile(tempFile.toString(), file.getOriginalFilename());
}
```

### **Best Practices**

âœ… Use **IAM roles** instead of hardcoded credentials.  
âœ… Enable **versioning** & **lifecycle policies**.  
âœ… Restrict **public access policies** for security.

#### **Q1: What is Amazon S3, and how does it work?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:** Amazon S3 is an object storage service where data is stored as objects inside buckets. Each object consists of data, metadata, and a unique key (name). It provides high availability and durability using automatic replication across multiple Availability Zones.

---

#### **Q2: What are the different storage classes in S3?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:**

1. **S3 Standard** â€“ High durability, low latency, used for frequently accessed data.
2. **S3 Intelligent-Tiering** â€“ Automatically moves data between Standard and Infrequent Access to optimize cost.
3. **S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)** â€“ Lower cost, good for data accessed less often.
4. **S3 One Zone-IA** â€“ Similar to IA but stored in a single AZ (less durable).
5. **S3 Glacier** â€“ Low-cost, used for archival storage, retrieval time in minutes/hours.
6. **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** â€“ Cheapest option for long-term data storage (retrieval takes hours).

---

#### **Q3: How do you secure an S3 bucket?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:**

1. **Bucket Policies** â€“ JSON-based rules to control access to the bucket.
2. **IAM Policies** â€“ Define permissions for users accessing S3.
3. **Block Public Access** â€“ Prevents accidental public exposure.
4. **Encryption** â€“ Data can be encrypted at rest (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS) and in transit (SSL/TLS).
5. **MFA Delete** â€“ Protects against accidental or malicious deletions.
6. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** â€“ Grants specific permissions to users and accounts.

---

#### **Q4: How does S3 Versioning help?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:** S3 Versioning allows you to store multiple versions of an object, preventing accidental deletions or overwrites. When enabled, every modification creates a new version instead of replacing the object.

---

#### **Q5: What is S3 Lifecycle Policy?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:** S3 Lifecycle Policy allows automatic transition of objects between storage classes or deletion after a specific period. For example:

- Move objects to Standard-IA after 30 days.
- Move to Glacier after 90 days.
- Delete objects after 1 year.

---

#### **Q6: How does S3 handle data consistency?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:**

- **Read-after-write consistency for new objects** â€“ You can read a newly created object immediately.
- **Eventual consistency for updates and deletes** â€“ If you update/delete an object, there might be a short delay before changes are reflected across all regions.

---

#### **Q7: How do you optimize cost in S3?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:**

1. **Choose the right storage class (Standard, IA, Glacier, Deep Archive).**
2. **Use Lifecycle Policies to move old data to cheaper storage.**
3. **Enable Intelligent-Tiering for automatic cost optimization.**
4. **Use S3 Object Expiration to automatically delete old files.**
5. **Compress files before uploading.**

---

#### **Q8: How does S3 integrate with other AWS services?**

ðŸ’¡ **Answer:**

- **AWS Lambda** â€“ Triggers functions on S3 events (file uploads, deletions).
- **CloudFront** â€“ Uses S3 as an origin for fast content delivery.
- **Athena** â€“ Queries data stored in S3 without a database.
- **Redshift Spectrum** â€“ Analyzes large datasets stored in S3.
- **S3 Select** â€“ Retrieves only specific data from objects instead of full files.

### **3. When to Use S3?**

âœ… Storing large amounts of data (images, videos, logs, backups).  
âœ… Hosting static websites.  
âœ… Data lake for big data analytics.  
âœ… Archiving data at low cost.  
âœ… Storing machine learning datasets.
