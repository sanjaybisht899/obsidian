### **Database Concepts**

A **database** is a structured collection of data that allows easy access, management, and updating. It helps store and organize data efficiently.

Example: A school database stores student names, roll numbers, and grades.

### **Definition of a Database**

A **database** is an organized collection of related data that can be accessed and managed electronically. It ensures data consistency, security, and easy retrieval.

Example: A bank database stores customer details, account balances, and transaction history.

### **Types of Databases**

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**
    
    - Stores data in tables with rows and columns.
    - Uses **SQL (Structured Query Language)** to manage data.
    - Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.
2. **NoSQL Databases**
    
    - Used for large-scale data and flexible schema.
    - Stores data in key-value pairs, documents, or graphs.
    - Example: MongoDB (Document-based), Redis (Key-Value), Cassandra (Columnar).
3. **Graph Databases**
    
    - Stores data as nodes and relationships.
    - Good for social networks, fraud detection, and recommendation engines.
    - Example: Neo4j, ArangoDB.
4. **Columnar Databases**
    
    - Stores data in columns instead of rows, optimizing queries for analytics.
    - Example: Apache Cassandra, Google Bigtable.

### **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**

A **DBMS** is software that helps users create, manage, and operate databases efficiently. It provides security, backup, and access control.

Example: MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

### **Database Models**

1. **Hierarchical Model**
    
    - Data is stored in a tree-like structure (parent-child relationship).
    - Example: Old IBM databases, Windows Registry.
2. **Network Model**
    
    - More flexible than the hierarchical model (supports multiple parent-child relationships).
    - Example: IDMS (Integrated Database Management System).
3. **Relational Model**
    
    - Stores data in tables with rows and columns.
    - Uses **keys (Primary, Foreign)** to link tables.
    - Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL.
4. **Object-oriented Model**
    
    - Stores data as objects, like in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming).
    - Example: db4o, ObjectDB.
5. **Document Model**
    
    - Stores data in document format (JSON, BSON, XML).
    - Used in NoSQL databases.
    - Example: MongoDB, CouchDB.

### **DBMS vs Database**

|Feature|DBMS (Database Management System)|Database|
|---|---|---|
|Definition|Software that manages databases|Collection of structured data|
|Function|Helps store, retrieve, update, and delete data|Stores data in tables, documents, or graphs|
|Example|MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle DB|Customer records, employee data|
|Data Handling|Provides tools for queries, transactions, and security|Only stores the data|
|User Interaction|Requires a DBMS to interact with data|Cannot be used directly without a DBMS|
