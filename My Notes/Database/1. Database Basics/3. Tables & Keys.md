### **Schemas**

**Definition:**  
A schema is a blueprint or organizational framework for a database. It defines the structure of the database and organizes its objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and procedures.


**Types of Schemas:**

- **Physical Schema:**  
    This defines how data is actually stored on disk or other storage devices. It covers file organization, storage paths, indexing on disk, and data block structures. The physical schema is concerned with performance, disk I/O, and space management.
    
- **Logical Schema:**  
    This is an abstract model that describes how data is organized in the database from a user or application perspective. It defines tables, columns, data types, relationships, and constraints, independent of the underlying storage details. The logical schema is used to design and enforce business rules and data integrity.

### **Tables**

**Definition:**  
A table is the fundamental unit of data storage in a relational database. It stores data in a structured format using rows and columns.

**Structure:**

- **Columns:**  
    Columns (or fields) define the attributes of the data. Each column has a specific name and data type (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, DATE) that determines what kind of data it can hold.
    
- **Rows:**  
    Rows (or records) represent individual entries in the table. Each row contains data corresponding to the defined columns, representing a single instance of an entity.

### **Keys**

Keys are critical in relational databases for ensuring data integrity and establishing relationships between tables.

**Primary Key:**

- A primary key is a column, or a combination of columns (composite key), that uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Characteristics:**
    - **Uniqueness:** Every row must have a unique primary key value.
    - **Non-nullability:** Primary key columns cannot contain NULL values.
    - **Stability:** Primary keys should remain constant; changes can complicate relationships with other tables.
- **Examples:**
    - A single-column primary key: `EmployeeID` in an Employees table.
    - A composite primary key: A combination of `StudentID` and `CourseID` in an Enrollment table.

**Foreign Key:**

- A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table.
- **Purpose:**
    - It establishes and enforces a link between the data in two tables, maintaining referential integrity.
- **Example:**
    - An `Orders` table might include a `CustomerID` foreign key that references the primary key of a `Customers` table.

**Composite Key:**

- A composite key is a primary key that consists of two or more columns used together to uniquely identify a record.
- **When to Use:**
    - It is used when a single column is not sufficient to ensure uniqueness.
- **Example:**
    - In a junction table for a many-to-many relationship, such as a table linking `StudentID` and `CourseID` in an Enrollment table.
