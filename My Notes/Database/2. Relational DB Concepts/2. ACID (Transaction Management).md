In databases, **ACID properties** ensure that transactions are processed reliably. A **transaction** is a set of operations that must be executed together. If any part fails, the entire transaction should be undone.

## **1. ACID Properties**

ACID stands for:

1️⃣ **Atomicity** – "All or Nothing"

- A transaction must be **fully completed or fully rolled back**.
- If any step fails, the entire transaction is undone.
- Example:
    - Transferring ₹1000 from Account A to Account B involves **debiting A and crediting B**. If the debit succeeds but the credit fails, the transaction is **rolled back**, so no money is lost.

2️⃣ **Consistency** – "Valid State"

- The database must always move from **one valid state to another**.
- It ensures that all integrity constraints (e.g., primary key, foreign key) are maintained.
- Example:
    - A bank transfer should not create or lose money—it should only move existing funds correctly.

3️⃣ **Isolation** – "No Interference"

- Transactions should **not affect each other** when running concurrently.
- Example:
    - Two people withdrawing money from the same account at the same time should not cause incorrect balances.

4️⃣ **Durability** – "Permanent Changes"

- Once a transaction is committed, it is **permanently saved** in the database, even if a crash occurs.
- Example:
    - If ₹1000 is transferred and the transaction is committed, the change remains even if the system crashes.

## **2. Transactions and Commit/Rollback**

A **transaction** is a group of operations performed as a single unit.

- **COMMIT** – Saves all changes permanently.
- **ROLLBACK** – Undoes all changes if something goes wrong.

### **Example in SQL:**

```sql
START TRANSACTION;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 1000 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 1000 WHERE account_id = 2;

COMMIT;  -- Saves the changes permanently
```

If something goes wrong (e.g., system crash), we can **ROLLBACK**:

```sql
ROLLBACK;  -- Undoes all changes
```

After **COMMIT**, you **cannot rollback** the transaction.
