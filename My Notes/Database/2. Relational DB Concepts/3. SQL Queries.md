SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with databases. It allows us to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data efficiently.

---
### **1️⃣ Basic SQL Queries**

#### **SELECT (Retrieving Data)**

Used to fetch data from a table.

```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
```

Example:

```sql
SELECT name, age FROM employees;
```

#### **INSERT (Adding Data)**

Used to add new rows to a table.

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);
```

Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, age) VALUES ('John', 30);
```

#### **UPDATE (Modifying Data)**

Used to update existing rows in a table.

```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'John';
```

#### **DELETE (Removing Data)**

Used to delete records from a table.

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Example:

```sql
DELETE FROM employees WHERE age > 60;
```

### **2️⃣ Filtering and Sorting Data**

#### **WHERE (Filtering Data)**

Used to filter rows based on a condition.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;
```

#### **ORDER BY (Sorting Results)**

Used to sort results in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY age DESC;
```

#### **GROUP BY (Grouping Results)**

Used with aggregate functions to group data.

```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department;
```

#### **HAVING (Filtering Grouped Results)**

Filters data **after** `GROUP BY` is applied.

```sql

SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

---

### **3️⃣ Joins (Combining Data from Multiple Tables)**

Joins are used to fetch related data from multiple tables.

#### **INNER JOIN** (Only matching records)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

#### **LEFT JOIN** (All records from the left table, even if no match)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

#### **RIGHT JOIN** (All records from the right table, even if no match)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

#### **FULL OUTER JOIN** (All records from both tables)

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
FULL OUTER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

#### **Self Join** (Joining a table with itself)

```sql
SELECT e1.name AS Employee, e2.name AS Manager
FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

#### **Cross Join** (Cartesian Product)

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees CROSS JOIN departments;
```

### LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns **all rows** from the **left table** and **matching rows** from the **right table**. If no match, `NULL` values are returned for the right table's columns.
    
    **Use case**: When you need all records from the left table, even if there’s no match in the right table.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
    ```
    
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns **all rows** from the **right table** and **matching rows** from the **left table**. If no match, `NULL` values are returned for the left table's columns.
    
    **Use case**: When you need all records from the right table, even if there’s no match in the left table.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
    FROM employees
    RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
    ```

### **4️⃣ Advanced Queries**

#### **Subqueries (Query inside another query)**

Example: Find employees older than the average age.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM employees);
```

#### **Correlated Subqueries (Uses outer query data)**

Example: Find employees earning more than the department's average salary.

```sql
SELECT name FROM employees e WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id);
```

#### **Set Operations**

- **UNION** (Combines results from multiple queries, removes duplicates)
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM employees UNION SELECT name FROM managers;
    ```
    
- **INTERSECT** (Only common records)
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM employees INTERSECT SELECT name FROM managers;
    ```
    
- **EXCEPT (MySQL: MINUS)** (Removes records from first query that exist in the second)
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM employees EXCEPT SELECT name FROM managers;
    ```
    

---

### **5️⃣ Aggregate Functions**

Used for calculations on a set of values.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;  -- Total employees
SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees;  -- Total salary expense
SELECT AVG(age) FROM employees;  -- Average age
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees;  -- Lowest salary
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees;  -- Highest salary
```

### **6️⃣ Join Optimization**

- **Indexing**: Speed up joins by indexing foreign keys.
- **Avoid SELECT ***: Fetch only necessary columns.
- **Use EXISTS instead of IN** for subqueries.
- **Optimize queries using EXPLAIN** (Shows execution plan).
