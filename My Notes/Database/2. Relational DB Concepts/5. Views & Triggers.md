### **Views**

- **Definition**: A **view** is a virtual table that is based on the result of a query. It does not store data but provides a way to access data from one or more tables in a simplified way.

---

#### **Creating and Dropping Views**

- **Create a View**:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW view_name AS
    SELECT column1, column2
    FROM table_name
    WHERE condition;
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
    SELECT name, department FROM employees WHERE active = 1;
    ```
    
- **Drop a View**:
    
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW view_name;
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```sql
    DROP VIEW employee_view;
    ```

#### **Updatable Views**

- **Definition**: A view is **updatable** if you can perform `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operations on the view, and those changes reflect in the underlying tables.
- **Requirements for an Updatable View**:
    - The view must not contain complex operations like `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`, etc.
    - The columns in the view should directly correspond to columns in the underlying table(s).

### **Triggers**

- **Definition**: A **trigger** is a special kind of stored procedure that automatically executes when an event (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) occurs on a specific table or view.

#### **Types of Triggers**:

- **BEFORE Trigger**: Executes before the actual operation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) takes place.
    
    Example: Before inserting a new record, validate data.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER before_insert_employee
    BEFORE INSERT ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- Data validation logic
    END;
    ```
    
- **AFTER Trigger**: Executes after the actual operation (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`) has been completed.
    
    Example: After an employee record is updated, log the change.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER after_update_employee
    AFTER UPDATE ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- Logging logic
    END;
    ```
    
- **INSERT Trigger**: A trigger that activates after an `INSERT` operation on a table.
    
    Example: Log data after a new row is added.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER after_insert_employee
    AFTER INSERT ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- Log the insertion
    END;
    ```
    
- **UPDATE Trigger**: A trigger that activates after an `UPDATE` operation on a table.
    
    Example: Automatically update audit columns.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER after_update_employee
    AFTER UPDATE ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- Update audit columns
    END;
    ```
    
- **DELETE Trigger**: A trigger that activates after a `DELETE` operation on a table.
    
    Example: Log data before a record is deleted.
    
    ```sql
    CREATE TRIGGER after_delete_employee
    AFTER DELETE ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
      -- Log the deletion
    END;
    ```
