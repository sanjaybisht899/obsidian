### **Isolation Levels (Handling Concurrent Transactions)**

Different **isolation levels** control how transactions interact with each other. These levels affect **data consistency** and **performance**.

| Isolation Level  | Issues Prevented    | Allows Dirty Read? | Allows Non-Repeatable Read? | Allows Phantom Read? |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Read Uncommitted | None                | ✅ Yes              | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                |
| Read Committed   | Dirty Read          | ❌ No               | ✅ Yes                       | ✅ Yes                |
| Repeatable Read  | Non-Repeatable Read | ❌ No               | ❌ No                        | ✅ Yes                |
| Serializable     | Phantom Read        | ❌ No               | ❌ No                        | ❌ No                 |

### **Common Issues in Transactions:**

1. **Dirty Read** – A transaction reads **uncommitted data** from another transaction.
2. **Non-Repeatable Read** – A row **changes** when read again **within the same transaction**.
3. **Phantom Read** – A **new row** appears when reading the same query twice.

### **Example of Isolation Levels:**

#### **1. Read Uncommitted (Lowest Isolation, Fastest but Risky)**

- **Scenario:**  
    Transaction 1 **updates** a row but **does not commit**.  
    Transaction 2 **reads** that uncommitted data, leading to an **incorrect result**.
    
- **Example (Dirty Read):**  
    **Session 1** (Transaction 1):
    
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE products SET price = 1500 WHERE id = 1; -- Uncommitted update
    ```
    
    **Session 2** (Transaction 2):
    
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 1; -- Reads uncommitted data (₹1500)
    COMMIT;
    ```
    

#### **2. Read Committed (Default in Most Databases)**

- **Scenario:**  
    Transaction 1 **can only read committed data** from other transactions.  
    **No dirty reads**, but **non-repeatable reads** can still happen.
    
- **Example (Non-Repeatable Read):**  
    **Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Read price):
    
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 1; -- Returns ₹1000
    -- Waiting...
    ```
    
    **Session 2** (Transaction 2 - Update price):
    
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE products SET price = 1200 WHERE id = 1;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    
    **Back to Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Read price again):
    
    ```sql
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 1; -- Now returns ₹1200 (Non-Repeatable Read)
    COMMIT;
    ```
    

#### **3. Repeatable Read (Stronger Isolation)**

- **Scenario:**  
    Prevents **dirty reads** and **non-repeatable reads**, but **phantom reads** can still occur.  
    Ensures **consistent values** for all rows read in the same transaction.
    
- **Example (Fixing Non-Repeatable Read):**  
    **Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Read price):
    
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;
    START TRANSACTION;
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 1; -- Returns ₹1000
    -- Waiting...
    ```
    
    **Session 2** (Transaction 2 - Update price):
    
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    UPDATE products SET price = 1200 WHERE id = 1;
    COMMIT;
    ```
    
    **Back to Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Read price again):
    
    ```sql
    SELECT price FROM products WHERE id = 1; -- Returns ₹1000 (Same value, no change)
    COMMIT;
    ```
    

#### **4. Serializable (Strongest Isolation, Slowest Performance)**

- **Scenario:**  
    Transactions are executed **one by one**.  
    Prevents **all concurrency issues**, but reduces speed. This is the **most strict isolation level**.
    
- **Example (Phantom Read Prevention):**  
    **Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Select pending orders):
    
    ```sql
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
    START TRANSACTION;
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'; -- Returns 5 rows
    -- Waiting...
    ```
    
    **Session 2** (Transaction 2 - Insert a new pending order):
    
    ```sql
    START TRANSACTION;
    INSERT INTO orders (id, status) VALUES (101, 'pending');
    COMMIT;
    ```
    
    **Back to Session 1** (Transaction 1 - Read pending orders again):
    
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending'; -- Returns 5 rows (No phantom rows)
    COMMIT;
    ```
