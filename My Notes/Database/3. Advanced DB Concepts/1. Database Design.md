### **Entity-Relationship Model (ER Diagram)**

- **Definition**: The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a conceptual framework used to represent data and its relationships. The model uses **entities**, **attributes**, and **relationships** to depict the structure of a database.
    
- **ER Diagram Components**:
    
    - **Entity**: Represents a real-world object or concept (e.g., `Employee`, `Customer`).
    - **Attribute**: Describes properties of an entity (e.g., `Employee Name`, `Employee ID`).
    - **Relationship**: Represents how entities are related (e.g., `Employee works in Department`).
- **ER Diagram Example**:

    ```
    [Employee]---(works_in)--[Department]
       |                          |
       |                          |
    [Employee Name]          [Department Name]
    ```

### **Cardinality Constraints**

- **Definition**: Cardinality constraints define the number of instances of one entity that can be associated with an instance of another entity. It ensures the correct relationships between entities.

#### **Types of Cardinality Constraints**:

- **One-to-One (1:1)**: Each instance of entity A is related to exactly one instance of entity B, and vice versa.
    
    Example: One `Person` has one `Passport`.
    
- **One-to-Many (1:M)**: One instance of entity A is related to many instances of entity B, but each instance of entity B is related to exactly one instance of entity A.
    
    Example: A `Department` can have many `Employees`, but each `Employee` works in one `Department`.
    
- **Many-to-Many (M:N)**: Many instances of entity A are related to many instances of entity B, and vice versa.
    
    Example: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.

### **Relationships**

- **One-to-One (1:1) Relationship**:
    
    - Example: A `Person` has one `Passport`.
    - In this case, each `Person` is linked to only one `Passport`, and vice versa.
    
    **Table Design**:
    
    - You can add a foreign key in either of the tables, or you can create a separate linking table.
- **One-to-Many (1:M) Relationship**:
    
    - Example: A `Department` has many `Employees`.
    - A `Department` can have multiple `Employees`, but each `Employee` belongs to one `Department`.
    
    **Table Design**:
    
    - The **Department** table contains basic information, and the **Employee** table will have a foreign key (`department_id`) referencing the `Department`.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Department Table:
    +-------------+--------------+
    | department_id | department_name |
    +-------------+--------------+
    
    Employee Table:
    +------------+-------------+--------------+
    | employee_id | name        | department_id |
    +------------+-------------+--------------+
    ```
    
- **Many-to-Many (M:N) Relationship**:
    
    - Example: A `Student` can enroll in many `Courses`, and a `Course` can have many `Students`.
    
    **Table Design**:
    
    - You need a **junction (or associative) table** to represent the many-to-many relationship. This table will contain foreign keys from both entities.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
    Student Table:
    +------------+-------------+
    | student_id | student_name |
    +------------+-------------+
    
    Course Table:
    +------------+----------------+
    | course_id  | course_name    |
    +------------+----------------+
    
    Student_Course Table (Junction Table):
    +------------+------------+
    | student_id | course_id  |
    +------------+------------+
    ```
    

### **Key Difference**:

- **Cardinality** is the **quantity** of the relationship (how many instances are involved).
- **Relationship** is the **type or nature** of the association between entities.

#### Example:

- In a **One-to-Many** relationship:
    - The **relationship** is that a `Department` can have many `Employees`.
    - The **cardinality** describes how many `Employees` can belong to one `Department` (many employees to one department).

So, **cardinality** is a characteristic of the **relationship**, specifying the number of associations.

### **Designing Tables with Proper Keys**

- **Primary Key**:
    
    - A **primary key** is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that each row is unique and can be referenced by other tables.
    
    Example:
    
    - `employee_id` can be a primary key for the `Employee` table.
- **Foreign Key**:
    
    - A **foreign key** is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table. It is used to create relationships between tables.
    
    Example:
    
    - `department_id` in the `Employee` table can be a foreign key that references the `Department` table.
- **Composite Key**:
    
    - A **composite key** is a primary key that consists of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record.
    
    Example:
    
    - In a `Student_Course` junction table, a combination of `student_id` and `course_id` can form a composite key.
