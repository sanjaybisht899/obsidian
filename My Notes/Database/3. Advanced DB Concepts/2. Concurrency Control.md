### **Locking Mechanisms**

Locking mechanisms are used in database systems to manage concurrent access to data and ensure data consistency. They prevent conflicts and ensure that multiple transactions do not interfere with each other. There are two main types of locking mechanisms:

#### **1. Pessimistic Locking**

- **Definition**: In pessimistic locking, a transaction assumes that conflicts will happen and locks the data for exclusive use as soon as it starts using it.
    
- **How it works**: When a transaction accesses a piece of data, it locks it so that no other transaction can modify or even read it until the lock is released (usually after the transaction is completed).
    
- **Use Case**: Useful when the system is highly contended or when the likelihood of conflicts is high (e.g., banking applications).
    
    Example: If two users try to update the same account balance, the second user will have to wait until the first one finishes.
    

#### **2. Optimistic Locking**

- **Definition**: Optimistic locking assumes that conflicts are rare and allows multiple transactions to work on the same data concurrently. It only checks for conflicts when a transaction is about to commit.
    
- **How it works**: Transactions are allowed to read and even modify data without locking it. Before committing the changes, the system checks if another transaction has modified the same data in the meantime. If there is no conflict, the transaction commits; otherwise, it is rolled back.
    
- **Use Case**: Suitable for scenarios where conflicts are infrequent (e.g., inventory systems).
    
    Example: Multiple users can update inventory records at the same time, but the system will check for changes before committing updates.

### **Deadlock and Its Prevention**

#### **What is Deadlock?**

- **Deadlock** occurs when two or more transactions are waiting for each other to release resources (like locks), and as a result, none of the transactions can proceed. This leads to a standstill.
    
    Example:
    
    - Transaction 1 locks **Resource A** and waits for **Resource B**.
    - Transaction 2 locks **Resource B** and waits for **Resource A**.
    - Both are stuck, and neither can proceed.

#### **Deadlock Prevention Techniques:**

1. **Timeouts**: A transaction is aborted if it has been waiting for a resource for too long, reducing the chances of deadlock.
    
2. **Wait-Die and Wound-Wait Schemes**:
    
    - **Wait-Die**: Older transactions are allowed to wait for younger transactions to release the resource, while younger transactions are aborted.
    - **Wound-Wait**: Older transactions are aborted if they request a resource held by a younger transaction, causing the younger transaction to "wait."
3. **Resource Allocation Graph**: A system that tracks which transaction holds which resource and which transactions are waiting for others to release resources. Deadlock can be prevented by analyzing this graph.

### **Transaction Isolation and Lock Granularity**

#### **Transaction Isolation**

- **Transaction Isolation** ensures that the operations of one transaction do not interfere with other transactions. The SQL standard defines different **isolation levels** that specify the degree of visibility one transaction has to other concurrent transactions.
    
    **Isolation Levels**:
    
    1. **Read Uncommitted**: Transactions can see uncommitted changes made by other transactions (dirty reads are allowed). This is the least isolated.
    2. **Read Committed**: Transactions can only see committed changes made by other transactions. Dirty reads are avoided, but non-repeatable reads can happen.
    3. **Repeatable Read**: Transactions can only see committed changes, and no other transaction can modify data being read by the current transaction (prevents non-repeatable reads). However, phantom reads can still occur.
    4. **Serializable**: The highest level of isolation. Transactions are executed in such a way that the result is as if transactions were executed serially, one after the other, without overlapping.

#### **Lock Granularity**

- **Lock Granularity** refers to the level of data that can be locked during a transaction. Finer granularity locks smaller parts of data (e.g., row-level locks), whereas coarser granularity locks larger parts (e.g., table-level locks).
    
    **Types of Locks**:
    
    1. **Table-Level Lock**: Locks the entire table, preventing other transactions from reading or modifying any row in the table.
    2. **Row-Level Lock**: Locks individual rows, allowing other transactions to modify other rows in the same table.
    3. **Page-Level Lock**: Locks a block (page) of rows, which is more granular than a table lock but less granular than a row lock.
    
    **Choosing the Right Granularity**:
    
    - **Fine Granularity** (e.g., row-level) provides better concurrency but can result in more overhead for managing locks.
    - **Coarse Granularity** (e.g., table-level) reduces the overhead but limits concurrency because more data is locked at once.
