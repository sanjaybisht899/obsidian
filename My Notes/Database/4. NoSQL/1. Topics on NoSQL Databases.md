#### **1. Types of NoSQL Databases**

NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data. They are categorized into different types based on how they store and manage data.

- **Document-based Databases**
- **Key-Value Stores**
- **Column-Family Stores**
- **Graph Databases**

---

#### **2. Document-based Databases**

- Store data as **documents** (typically in JSON, BSON, or XML format).
- Each document contains key-value pairs, making it flexible and schema-less.
- Used in applications requiring hierarchical and flexible data storage.

**Examples:**

- **MongoDB** – Popular for web apps, real-time analytics.
- **CouchDB** – Uses a RESTful API and stores data in JSON format.

**Use Cases:**

- Content Management Systems (CMS).
- E-commerce product catalogs.
- User profiles and settings.

---

#### **3. Key-Value Stores**

- Data is stored as **key-value pairs** in a highly efficient and fast-access manner.
- Ideal for caching and real-time applications.

**Examples:**

- **Redis** – In-memory store, used for caching and session management.
- **DynamoDB** – AWS-managed NoSQL database with automatic scaling.

**Use Cases:**

- Caching frequently accessed data.
- Storing user session data.
- Leaderboards in gaming applications.

---

#### **4. Column-Family Stores**

- Store data in **columns instead of rows**, optimized for high write/read performance.
- Used in big data applications where large amounts of data need to be processed quickly.

**Examples:**

- **Cassandra** – Decentralized, high-availability database used by Facebook and Netflix.
- **HBase** – Built on Hadoop, used for large-scale distributed storage.

**Use Cases:**

- Real-time analytics and logging.
- Large-scale messaging systems.
- Recommendation engines.

---

#### **5. Graph Databases**

- Designed to store and manage data in **nodes and relationships**.
- Efficient for handling complex relationships in data.

**Examples:**

- **Neo4j** – Used for social networks, fraud detection.
- **ArangoDB** – Multi-model database supporting graph and document storage.

**Use Cases:**

- Social network data (e.g., friends, likes, followers).
- Fraud detection and recommendation systems.
- Supply chain and logistics.
