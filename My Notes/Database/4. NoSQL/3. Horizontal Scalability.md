#### **Definition**

Horizontal scalability (also called **scale-out**) refers to **adding more machines (servers or nodes) to a system** to distribute the workload and handle increased traffic or data volume.

#### **How It Works**

Instead of upgrading a single powerful server (**vertical scaling**), horizontal scaling spreads the data across multiple machines. This allows better performance, fault tolerance, and cost efficiency.

#### **Example in Databases**

- **SQL Databases:** Typically use **vertical scaling** by upgrading the server (CPU, RAM).
- **NoSQL Databases (like MongoDB, Cassandra):** Use **horizontal scaling** by distributing data across multiple servers (**sharding**).

#### **Sharding in MongoDB (Example of Horizontal Scaling)**

MongoDB uses **sharding** to split large datasets across multiple servers.

- Example: A **users** collection is split based on **region**, so different servers handle different regions.

```js
sh.enableSharding("myDatabase") // Enable sharding
db.users.createIndex({region: 1}) // Create index for sharding
sh.shardCollection("myDatabase.users", { region: 1 }) // Distribute data
```

#### **Advantages of Horizontal Scaling**

✅ **Handles large traffic efficiently** – Multiple servers work together.  
✅ **Prevents a single point of failure** – If one server crashes, others handle requests.  
✅ **More cost-effective** – Instead of upgrading a single expensive server, multiple lower-cost machines are used.  
✅ **Supports distributed databases** – Used in **NoSQL** databases like MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB.

#### **When to Use Horizontal Scaling?**

- When **data volume** increases beyond a single server’s capacity.
- When you need **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.
- When applications require **low latency** (**Low Latency** = Fast response time) and faster performance.
