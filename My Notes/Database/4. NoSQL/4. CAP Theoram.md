#### **What is CAP Theorem?**

CAP Theorem states that in a distributed database (one that runs on multiple servers), we can **only guarantee two out of three** properties at the same time:

1. **Consistency (C)** – Every user sees the same data, no matter which server they connect to.
2. **Availability (A)** – The system always responds to requests, even if some servers fail.
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)** – The system keeps running even if network issues occur between servers.

### **Why Can't We Have All Three?**

Imagine a database running on **two servers** that store the same data. These servers are in different locations and communicate over a network. Now, suppose the network between them **fails** (a partition happens).

#### **Case 1: Prioritizing Consistency and Partition Tolerance (CP)**

- If a user **updates data** on Server 1, but Server 2 is **disconnected** due to a network issue, we must **stop Server 2 from responding** until it gets the latest data.
- This ensures **data consistency** but makes the system **unavailable** on Server 2.
- Example: **Bank transactions** → The system should never allow incorrect balances, so it may **reject requests** until all servers are in sync.

#### **Case 2: Prioritizing Availability and Partition Tolerance (AP)**

- If a user **updates data** on Server 1, but Server 2 is disconnected, we allow **both servers to keep running independently**.
- This means **Server 2 might serve outdated data**, but at least it’s still available.
- Example: **Social media feeds** → If a network issue happens, users might see old posts, but they can still use the app.

#### **Case 3: Prioritizing Consistency and Availability (CA) – Not Possible in a Distributed System**

- For **both consistency and availability**, every server needs to always have the latest data **and** always be online.
- But if the network fails, servers can’t communicate and stay in sync.
- This means we **must choose between stopping updates (to stay consistent) or allowing updates with outdated data**.
- **Distributed databases must tolerate network failures (P), so CA is not possible**.

### **How Databases Choose Between CP and AP**

- **CP Databases (Strong Consistency, Less Availability)**:
    - **Example**: MongoDB (with strong consistency settings)
    - Used in **banking, inventory systems** where data correctness is more important than speed.
- **AP Databases (High Availability, Less Consistency)**:
    - **Example**: Cassandra, DynamoDB
    - Used in **social media, e-commerce recommendations** where availability matters more than perfect accuracy.
