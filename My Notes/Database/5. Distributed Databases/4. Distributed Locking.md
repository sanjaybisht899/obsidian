When multiple instances of a system operate on shared data in a distributed environment, **distributed locking** ensures that only one process modifies the data at a time. This prevents **race conditions, deadlocks, and data inconsistency**.

---

## **1. Why Do We Need Distributed Locking?**

- **Avoid Data Corruption**: Prevents multiple processes from modifying the same data simultaneously.
- **Ensure Atomic Operations**: Critical for transactions like **bank transfers, order processing**, etc.
- **Prevent Race Conditions**: Ensures that updates are processed in the correct order.

---

## **2. Approaches for Distributed Locking**

### **A. Database-Based Locks**

Use a database table to maintain lock status.

#### **Example: MySQL-Based Locking**

```sql
-- Process 1 tries to acquire the lock
INSERT INTO locks (resource, locked_by) VALUES ('order_101', 'process_1');

-- Process 2 fails if the lock exists
INSERT INTO locks (resource, locked_by) VALUES ('order_101', 'process_2'); -- Fails

-- Release the lock
DELETE FROM locks WHERE resource = 'order_101';
```

#### **Pros:**

✔ Easy to implement.  
✔ Works with existing databases.

#### **Cons:**

❌ Slow due to database overhead.  
❌ Not scalable for high-concurrency applications.

---

### **B. Redis-Based Distributed Locks (Using SETNX)**

Redis provides a **fast, in-memory distributed locking mechanism**.

#### **Implementation Using Redis SETNX**

```java
Jedis jedis = new Jedis("localhost");
String lockKey = "order_101";
String lockValue = UUID.randomUUID().toString();

// Try acquiring the lock
if (jedis.setnx(lockKey, lockValue) == 1) {
    // Lock acquired, process the request
    System.out.println("Lock acquired!");

    // Release the lock (Only if you own it)
    if (lockValue.equals(jedis.get(lockKey))) {
        jedis.del(lockKey);
    }
} else {
    System.out.println("Lock already held by another process.");
}
```

#### **Pros:**

✔ Fast and scalable.  
✔ Suitable for high-concurrency systems.

#### **Cons:**

❌ Requires Redis as an external dependency.  
❌ Doesn’t prevent **deadlocks** (use TTL to avoid).

---

### **C. Zookeeper-Based Locks (Leader Election)**

Zookeeper provides **strongly consistent** distributed locking.

#### **Steps:**

1. Each process creates an **ephemeral sequential ZNode**.
2. The process with the **smallest ZNode ID** holds the lock.
3. Other processes watch the **previous ZNode** and wait.
4. When the **holder releases the lock**, the next process takes over.

#### **Example Using Apache Curator (Java)**

```java
CuratorFramework client = CuratorFrameworkFactory.newClient("zk_server:2181", new RetryOneTime(1000));
client.start();

InterProcessMutex lock = new InterProcessMutex(client, "/locks/order_101");

try {
    lock.acquire();
    System.out.println("Lock acquired!");
    // Process the critical section
} finally {
    lock.release();
    System.out.println("Lock released!");
}
```

#### **Pros:**

✔ Strong consistency.  
✔ Handles failures gracefully.

#### **Cons:**

❌ Slower than Redis.  
❌ Requires **Zookeeper** setup.

---

## **3. Concurrency Control Strategies**

### **A. Optimistic Locking (Better for Read-heavy Workloads)**

- Assumes that **conflicts are rare**.
- Uses **versioning or timestamps** to check for changes before updating.

#### **Example Using SQL**

```sql
UPDATE orders 
SET status = 'shipped', version = version + 1
WHERE id = 101 AND version = 5;
```

- If another process modified **version = 5**, the update fails.

#### **Pros:**

✔ High performance in **low-contention** environments.  
✔ No need for explicit locks.

#### **Cons:**

❌ Requires retry logic in case of failures.

---

### **B. Pessimistic Locking (Better for Write-heavy Workloads)**

- **Locks a row** before updating.
- Prevents other transactions from modifying it.

#### **Example Using SQL**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE id = 101 FOR UPDATE; -- Locks the row
UPDATE orders SET status = 'shipped' WHERE id = 101;
COMMIT;
```

#### **Pros:**

✔ Guarantees safe updates.  
✔ Prevents **dirty reads** and **race conditions**.

#### **Cons:**

❌ Slower due to lock waiting.  
❌ Can cause **deadlocks**.

---

## **4. Avoiding Deadlocks in Distributed Locking**

- **Use Timeouts** (e.g., Redis locks expire after 5 sec).
- **Order Resources Consistently** (Lock A → Lock B always in the same order).
- **Use Deadlock Detection** (DBMS automatically resolves conflicts).

---

## **5. Choosing the Right Locking Mechanism**

|Locking Mechanism|Best For|Consistency|Speed|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Database Locks**|Simple apps, low concurrency|Strong|Slow|
|**Redis Locks**|High concurrency, fast systems|Eventual|Fast|
|**Zookeeper Locks**|Distributed consistency|Strong|Medium|

---

## **Conclusion**

- **Use Redis locks** if speed is a priority.
- **Use Zookeeper** if strong consistency is required.
- **Use optimistic locking** for read-heavy workloads.
- **Use pessimistic locking** when updates are frequent.
