### **1. High-Level Architecture of Vymo**

Vymo follows a **microservices-based architecture** where different modules handle distinct responsibilities. The key components include:

- **LMS (Lead Management System)** – Handles lead tracking, distribution, and automation.
- **CRM Integration Layer** – Connects with external CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.).
- **Authentication & Authorization** – Uses **OAuth2 / JWT** for securing services.
- **Notification & Workflow Engine** – Sends notifications and automates tasks based on events.
- **Data Layer** – Uses **MySQL for structured data** and **MongoDB for unstructured data**.
- **Caching Layer** – Uses **Redis for fast data retrieval**.
- **Messaging & Event Processing** – Uses **Kafka for async communication**.
- **Deployment & Infra** – Uses **Kubernetes (K8s) on AWS/GCP** for container orchestration.

---

### **2. How Microservices Interact in the System**

- **Synchronous Communication** → **REST APIs with Spring Boot** (for real-time operations like fetching lead details).
- **Asynchronous Communication** → **Kafka** (for events like lead assignment notifications).
- **Service Discovery** → **Eureka / Kubernetes Service Mesh** (ensures microservices can locate each other dynamically).
- **API Gateway** → Uses **Spring Cloud Gateway or Kong** for routing and security.

---

### **3. Event-Driven Architecture vs. Request-Response Model**

- **Request-Response (REST + gRPC)** → Used when immediate responses are needed (e.g., fetching user details).
- **Event-Driven (Kafka + Webhooks)** → Used for handling background tasks (e.g., lead status updates, notifications).
- **Hybrid Approach** → REST for direct calls, but Kafka for scalable async processing.

Example:

- A sales agent **adds a new lead** → REST API call updates the **LMS DB** → An event is published to Kafka → The **Notification Service** picks it up and sends an email/SMS.

---

### **4. Monolithic vs. Microservices Decision-Making**

- **Why Microservices?**
    
    - Each module (LMS, CRM, Notification) can scale independently.
    - Enables client-specific customizations.
    - Easier fault isolation.
- **Challenges of Microservices**
    
    - More complex **deployment & service coordination**.
    - **Data consistency issues** (resolved using event-driven architecture).
    - **Latency overhead** due to network calls.
- **Alternative Considerations**
    
    - **Monolithic Approach** might be suitable for smaller, internal tools.
    - **Modular Monolith** (single app, multiple modules) could work for LMS core functionalities.

---

### **5. Inter-Service Communication (REST, gRPC, Kafka)**

- **REST (Spring Boot APIs)** → Used for synchronous calls (User Service fetching Lead data).
- **gRPC (Optional for High-Performance Services)** → Could be used for internal service-to-service communication (e.g., between LMS and Workflow Engine).
- **Kafka (Event Bus)** → Used for handling background tasks and ensuring reliability in processing (lead assignment, notifications).

---

### **6. Scalability Strategies**

Vymo ensures scalability using:

- **Stateless Microservices** → Services are stateless so they can be horizontally scaled.
- **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** → Scales services based on CPU/memory usage.
- **Read Replicas (MySQL, MongoDB)** → Distributes read traffic to reduce load on the primary DB.
- **CDN for Static Content** → Reduces load on backend services.
- **Asynchronous Processing (Kafka)** → Moves heavy workloads (report generation, notifications) to background jobs.

---

### **7. High Availability & Fault Tolerance**

- **Kubernetes Multi-Zone Deployment** → Services run across multiple availability zones.
- **Database Failover (MySQL & MongoDB Clusters)** → Uses **replication & failover mechanisms**.
- **Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j / Hystrix)** → Prevents cascading failures in microservices.
- **Retries & Backoff (Spring Retry + Kafka DLQ)** → Ensures failed requests are retried before giving up.

Example:

- If **Lead Service** goes down, the **API Gateway** reroutes requests to a backup instance.

---

### **8. Data Consistency Across Microservices**

- **Eventual Consistency** → Uses **Kafka-based event sourcing** to sync data across services.
- **Distributed Transactions (SAGA Pattern)** → For multi-step operations across microservices (e.g., updating lead info and CRM simultaneously).
- **Outbox Pattern** → Ensures events are not lost if a service crashes.

Example:

- A lead’s status is updated in LMS → An event is fired → CRM syncs the updated lead details.

---

### **9. Caching Strategies**

- **Redis (Primary Cache for API Responses)** → Speeds up frequent queries (e.g., fetching user profile).
- **Local Caching (Caffeine Cache in Spring Boot)** → Used for temporary in-memory caching within microservices.
- **Database Query Caching (MySQL Query Cache, MongoDB Indexing)** → Improves DB query performance.
- **TTL-based Expiry** → Ensures stale data is automatically refreshed.

Example:

- A frequently accessed API (`GET /leads`) caches results in Redis with a **5-minute TTL**.

---

### **10. API Versioning Strategies**

- **URL-Based Versioning (`/api/v1/leads`)** → Ensures backward compatibility.
- **Header-Based Versioning (`Accept-Version: v1`)** → Allows clients to specify the version.
- **Feature Flagging (LaunchDarkly or Custom Feature Toggle)** → Allows gradual rollout of new features.

Example:

- `/api/v1/users` → Returns basic user info.
- `/api/v2/users` → Returns additional fields like "last active timestamp".

---

### **11. Load Balancing Strategies**

- **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway, Kong, Nginx)** → Routes traffic to healthy instances.
- **Kubernetes LoadBalancer + Ingress Controller** → Balances traffic between microservices.
- **Database Connection Pooling (HikariCP in Spring Boot)** → Manages DB connections efficiently.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** → Prevents API abuse using **Redis-based rate limits**.

Example:

- If **Lead Service** is experiencing high traffic, **K8s automatically spins up new pods** to handle the load.

---

### **12. Database Optimization Strategies**

- **Indexing (MySQL, MongoDB)** → Creates indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `lead_id`).
- **Partitioning & Sharding** → Spreads data across multiple DB nodes to avoid bottlenecks.
- **Read Replicas** → Directs read-heavy queries to secondary DB nodes.
- **Connection Pooling (HikariCP)** → Reduces DB latency by reusing connections.
- **Batch Processing** → Uses batch updates instead of multiple small queries to improve efficiency.

Example:

- Instead of querying **all leads for a client**, we **paginate queries** (`LIMIT 50 OFFSET 100`) for better performance.
