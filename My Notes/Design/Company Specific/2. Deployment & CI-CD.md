### 1. How is your CI/CD pipeline structured?**

- **Branching Strategy:** Feature branches are created from `master`, `stage`, or `pod-stage`.
- **Pipeline Stages:**
    - Code is committed, PR is raised, and after two approvals, it is merged.
    - Build creation and deployment happen for `pod`.
    - Cherry-picked PRs are raised to `staging` and then `release`.
    - Finally, `preprod` and `production` deployments follow.
- **CI/CD Tools:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD (if using Kubernetes).
- **Testing Stages:** Unit Tests â†’ Integration Tests â†’ Regression Tests â†’ Performance Tests before production.

---

### **2. What steps are involved in your deployment process?**

- **Step 1:** Developer raises a PR â†’ gets reviewed and approved.
- **Step 2:** Automated build and tests are triggered.
- **Step 3:** If successful, the service is deployed in `pod` for initial testing.
- **Step 4:** Bug fixes and testing happen in `pod`.
- **Step 5:** If stable, cherry-pick PR is raised to `staging`.
- **Step 6:** Staging deployment and testing occur.
- **Step 7:** PR is raised to `release`, followed by `preprod` deployment.
- **Step 8:** Final production deployment is performed.

### **3. How do you handle rollback in case of a failed deployment?**

- **Immediate Rollback:** Revert to the last stable build using Kubernetes rollbacks or ArgoCD.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Switch traffic back to the stable version.
- **Database Rollbacks:** Use Liquibase/Flyway for version-controlled schema migrations.
- **Canary Testing:** If canary fails, revert canary deployment and avoid full rollout.

---

### **4. How do you manage feature releases? (Feature flags, blue-green, canary)**

- **Feature Flags:** Controlled using `config-service` to enable/disable features dynamically.
- **Blue-Green Deployments:** Used for zero-downtime deployment by switching traffic between old and new versions.
- **Canary Releases:** Deploy to a small % of users before full rollout.

---

### **5. What testing strategies do you use before deploying to production?**

- **Unit Testing:** JUnit + Mockito for service-level testing.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between microservices.
- **Contract Testing:** Pact for ensuring API compatibility.
- **Performance Testing:** JMeter for load and stress testing.
- **Security Testing:** Static analysis (Snyk), dynamic security testing (OWASP ZAP).
- **Chaos Testing:** Simulate failures to test resilience.

---

### **6. How do you ensure zero downtime deployment?**

- **Rolling Updates:** Kubernetes rolling updates ensure smooth transitions.
- **Blue-Green Deployment:** Shift traffic between `blue` (current) and `green` (new) versions.
- **Database Migrations:** Use backward-compatible DB changes with feature flags.
- **Auto-Scaling:** Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) ensures capacity during deployments.

---

### **7. How do you handle environment-specific configurations?**

- **Config Server:** Centralized configuration via Spring Cloud Config.
- **Environment Variables:** Secrets managed via Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Externalized Properties:** YAML files per environment (`application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`).
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamically fetch configs from a registry (Eureka or Consul).
