### **1. How do you handle multi-tenant databases?**

Vymo supports multiple clients (HDFC, SBI, etc.), and **multi-tenancy** is handled using:

- **Schema-Based Multi-Tenancy:**
    - Each client has a separate schema (`lms_hdfc`, `lms_sbi`), keeping data isolated.
    - This prevents data leaks and simplifies access control.
- **Row-Based Multi-Tenancy (Partitioned Tables):**
    - A shared database with a **tenant_id** column in every table.
    - Ensures efficient indexing and retrieval per client.
- **Connection Pooling (HikariCP for Java Apps):**
    - Ensures efficient connections to different tenant schemas.
- **Routing Logic:**
    - Based on the request subdomain (`hdfc.lms.getvymo.com`), the correct schema is selected dynamically.

### **2. How do you manage schema migrations?**

Schema changes are managed through **Liquibase/Flyway** in a structured way:

- **Versioned SQL scripts:**
    - Applied in a controlled manner using CI/CD.
- **Backward Compatibility:**
    - New columns are added without breaking existing functionality.
- **Database Change Management:**
    - PR-based reviews before applying changes to staging/prod.
- **Automated Migrations:**
    - CI/CD triggers migrations when new code is deployed.

### **3. How do you optimize read and write performance?**

To ensure **high performance**, Vymo uses:

- **Read Replicas:**
    - Heavy read queries are routed to MySQL/MongoDB replicas.
- **Database Indexing:**
    - Composite indexes on frequently queried columns.
- **Caching Strategies:**
    - **Redis Cache** for frequently accessed data.
    - **Write-through cache** to ensure consistency.
- **Batch Inserts & Bulk Updates:**
    - Reduces transaction overhead.
- **Sharding Strategy (if needed):**
    - Large datasets are partitioned to improve performance.

### **4. How do you handle database failover?**

- **Primary-Replica Setup:**
    - **Automatic failover** using MySQL/MongoDB replication.
    - If the primary fails, traffic switches to the replica.
- **Load Balancer for DB Connections:**
    - Applications retry connections automatically.
- **HAProxy / ProxySQL:**
    - Ensures seamless failover between replicas.

### **5. What backup and disaster recovery strategies do you use?**

- **Daily Automated Backups:**
    - Scheduled snapshots for **MySQL & MongoDB**.
- **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR):**
    - Logs are stored for granular recovery.
- **Cross-Region Backups (AWS S3 / GCP Storage):**
    - Backups are stored in a **different region** for disaster recovery.
- **Failover Datacenter Strategy:**
    - Standby replicas in a secondary data center.
- **Restore Testing:**
    - Regular validation of backup integrity.
