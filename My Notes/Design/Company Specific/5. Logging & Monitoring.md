### **1. What logging framework do you use?**

Since Vymo's backend is **Java-based (Spring Boot)**, the primary logging frameworks are:

- **SLF4J with Logback:**
    - Provides structured logging with different log levels (**INFO, DEBUG, ERROR, WARN**).
    - Supports JSON logging for better integration with log aggregators.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.**
- **Loki (by Grafana) for real-time log analysis.**

---

### **2. How do you handle log aggregation?**

To collect and analyze logs across multiple microservices:

- **Fluentd / Logstash:**
    - Aggregates logs from multiple services and forwards them to **Elasticsearch**.
- **Kibana (ELK) / Grafana (Loki):**
    - Allows developers to **search, filter, and visualize logs** in real-time.
- **AWS CloudWatch / GCP Stackdriver:**
    - Stores logs for cloud-native microservices.
- **Correlation ID for tracing:**
    - Each request is tagged with a unique **trace ID** (UUID) to track requests across microservices.

---

### **3. What monitoring tools are used?**

Vymo ensures system health using:

- **Prometheus (Metrics Collection) & Grafana (Visualization):**
    - **Tracks CPU, memory, response times, request rates, and error rates.**
    - **Alerts when thresholds are exceeded.**
- **Jaeger / OpenTelemetry (Distributed Tracing):**
    - Helps track requests across microservices.
- **New Relic / Datadog:**
    - **APM (Application Performance Monitoring)** for identifying slow API calls.

---

### **4. How do you set up alerts for critical failures?**

- **Prometheus Alertmanager:**
    - Detects anomalies and triggers alerts.
- **Slack / PagerDuty / Opsgenie Integration:**
    - Sends real-time alerts to DevOps teams.
- **Health Checks with Kubernetes Probes:**
    - **Liveness & Readiness probes** auto-restart failing services.
- **Custom Alert Rules:**
    - **High error rates (5xx responses)** â†’ Notify engineers.
    - **Database connection failures** â†’ Trigger auto-recovery.

---

### **5. How do you analyze system performance and bottlenecks?**

- **APM Tools (New Relic, Datadog, Jaeger):**
    - Helps identify slow database queries and API bottlenecks.
- **Profiling with Java Flight Recorder (JFR) & VisualVM:**
    - Detects memory leaks, CPU spikes, and thread contention.
- **Kubernetes Resource Limits & Auto-Scaling:**
    - Ensures services do not consume excessive CPU/RAM.
- **Slow Query Logging in MySQL / MongoDB:**
    - Helps optimize indexes and queries.

---

### **Conclusion**

Vymoâ€™s logging & monitoring setup ensures **real-time visibility, automated alerts, and in-depth performance analysis**, helping maintain **high availability and quick troubleshooting**. ðŸš€
