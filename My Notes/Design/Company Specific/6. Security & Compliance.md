### **1. How do you handle authentication and authorization?**

Vymo follows a **zero-trust security model** and uses:

- **Authentication:**
    
    - **OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC)** → Uses **Keycloak/Auth0/AWS Cognito** for identity management.
    - **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless authentication.
    - **SAML-based SSO** for enterprise customers.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for high-security access.
- **Authorization:**
    
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Defines permissions at the **user, team, and org level**.
    - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):** Restricts access based on request attributes (e.g., IP, device, location).

### **2. What security measures do you have in API communication?**

- **HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3) enforced** → Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for microservices** → Ensures secure service-to-service communication.
- **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) signatures** → Validates API requests.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling** (via API Gateway) → Prevents API abuse.
- **IP Whitelisting for sensitive APIs** → Restricts access to trusted networks.

### **3. How do you manage secrets and environment variables?**

- **Vault-based secret management:**
    - **HashiCorp Vault / AWS Secrets Manager / Kubernetes Secrets.**
- **Environment variables stored in encrypted config maps** → Prevents leakage.
- **Secrets rotated regularly** with audit logging.
- **No hardcoded secrets in code** (validated via CI/CD static analysis).

### **4. How do you handle data encryption?**

- **Encryption at Rest:**
    - **AWS KMS / GCP KMS** manages encryption keys.
    - **MySQL/MongoDB: AES-256 encryption** for sensitive data.
- **Encryption in Transit:**
    - **TLS 1.2/1.3 for all traffic** (internal & external).
    - **gRPC with TLS** for microservice communication.
- **Field-Level Encryption:**
    - Sensitive fields (e.g., passwords, tokens, PII) are encrypted before storage.
- **Tokenization for PCI DSS compliance** (for financial transactions).

### **5. What measures are taken to prevent DDoS attacks?**

- **API Gateway Rate Limiting** (AWS WAF, Cloudflare, Kong API Gateway).
- **CDN & Edge Security** (Cloudflare, AWS Shield) → Mitigates bot traffic.
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Protects against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF.
- **Bot Detection & CAPTCHA for login attempts.**
- **Autoscaling & Load Balancing** → Absorbs attack traffic without service disruption.
- **Real-time Threat Monitoring** (AWS GuardDuty, GCP Security Command Center).
