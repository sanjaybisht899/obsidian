### **1. What is your branching strategy? (Git Flow, Trunk-based, etc.)**

✅ **Hybrid Git Flow Strategy** (Mix of **GitFlow** and **Trunk-Based Development**)

- **Feature branches** → Developers create a branch from `master` or `stage` (e.g., `feature/new-reporting`).
- **Pod environment testing** → PR is raised to **pod environment** before merging to staging.
- **Cherry-pick to staging** → Once stable, commits are cherry-picked to `stage`.
- **Release branches** → When ready, a release branch (`release-vX.Y.Z`) is created from `stage`.
- **Production deployment** → After preprod testing, the release is merged to `master`.

**Key Branches:**

- `master` → Stable production code.
- `stage` → Pre-production, tested features before release.
- `pod-stage` → Intermediate testing environment.
- `feature/*` → Feature development.
- `hotfix/*` → Quick fixes for production issues.

### **2. How do you handle code reviews?**

✅ **Strict PR Review Process:**

- **Minimum 2 approvals** required for merging.
- **Static Code Analysis (SonarQube, Checkstyle, SpotBugs)** before PR approval.
- **Automated tests (Unit + Integration + API tests)** must pass before merge.
- **Security scans (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)** for vulnerabilities.
- **Review checklist** ensures proper documentation & test cases are included.

✅ **Best Practices:**

- Small, incremental PRs for easy review.
- Use **ADR (Architectural Decision Records)** for major changes.
- Enforce **code ownership** via GitHub CODEOWNERS.

### **3. How do you merge and deploy multiple PRs at once?**

✅ **Batch Merging Strategy:**

- PRs are merged into `pod-stage`, verified, then cherry-picked to `stage`.
- If conflicts arise, **rebase-based merging** is done before final approval.
- **Feature Flags** allow safe enable/disable of merged features.

✅ **Automated Deployment Pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions):**

- Once merged, a CI/CD pipeline triggers auto-deployment to preprod.
- **Feature toggles (LaunchDarkly / Unleash)** allow gradual rollouts.
- **Blue-Green Deployment** ensures seamless production release.

### **4. How do you ensure minimal conflicts in a shared development environment?**

✅ **Environment Isolation:**

- **Hybrid environment model:** Shared staging + ephemeral environments for feature testing.
- Teams get **dedicated namespaces in Kubernetes** for independent testing.

✅ **Database Versioning & Schema Management:**

- **Liquibase/Flyway** ensures DB migrations are versioned.
- **Read replicas & DB sandboxing** help avoid conflicts.

✅ **Automated Conflict Detection:**

- **Pre-merge checks** identify conflicts before merging.
- **Git Hooks & Static Analysis** catch issues early.
- **Merge queues** prevent conflicting PRs from being merged simultaneously.
