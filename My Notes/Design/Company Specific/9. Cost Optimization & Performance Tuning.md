### **1. How do you optimize cloud infrastructure costs?**

✅ **Right-Sizing & Auto-Scaling:**

- **Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA)** to scale resources based on CPU & memory usage.
- **EC2 Spot Instances / Reserved Instances** for cost-effective compute.
- **Serverless Functions (AWS Lambda)** for lightweight, event-driven processing.

✅ **Storage Optimization:**

- **Lifecycle policies** for S3 buckets to automatically archive old data.
- **Database partitioning & archiving** for infrequently accessed records.
- **Compression techniques (Snappy, GZIP)** to reduce storage costs.

✅ **Observability & Cost Tracking:**

- **AWS Cost Explorer / GCP Cost Management** to monitor resource usage.
- **Kubecost** for Kubernetes cost breakdown at a pod/service level.

### **2. How do you optimize database performance?**

✅ **Indexing & Query Optimization:**

- **Proper indexing strategies** (B-Trees, Hash Indexes) on frequently queried fields.
- **Query caching (Redis, Memcached)** to reduce redundant DB calls.
- **Read replicas** to handle high-read traffic separately from writes.

✅ **Connection Pooling & Sharding:**

- **HikariCP for efficient DB connection pooling** in Spring Boot.
- **Database sharding** for load distribution across multiple DB instances.
- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)** for faster transaction commits.

✅ **Caching Strategies:**

- **Application-level caching (Redis, Ehcache, Caffeine)** to avoid unnecessary DB hits.
- **CDN (CloudFront, Cloudflare)** to cache static assets & API responses.

### **3. How do you scale down unused environments?**

✅ **Ephemeral Environments:**

- **Sandbox environments are auto-terminated** after a fixed time.
- **Terraform & Helm** to provision and tear down environments on demand.
- **Nightly shutdown scripts** for non-critical environments to save costs.

✅ **Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

- **Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler** to scale down unused nodes.
- **Lambda-based cleanup scripts** to delete old test data and stale resources.
- **Scheduled job execution (AWS EventBridge, GCP Cloud Scheduler)** to scale environments during business hours only.

### **4. What strategies are used to reduce network latency?**

✅ **Optimized API Communication:**

- **gRPC over HTTP for faster inter-service communication** in microservices.
- **Persistent connections (Keep-Alive, HTTP/2)** to reduce handshake latency.
- **Request batching & async processing** to minimize API round trips.

✅ **Efficient Routing & Caching:**

- **Edge caching via CDNs** (CloudFront, Fastly) to serve content faster.
- **Local caching using Redis / In-Memory stores** for frequently accessed data.
- **DNS Load Balancing & Geo-routing** to route traffic efficiently based on location.

✅ **Database Query & Data Transfer Optimization:**

- **Pagination & Lazy Loading** to fetch only required data.
- **Compression (Snappy, Brotli, Gzip)** to reduce data transfer size.
- **Query execution plans (EXPLAIN ANALYZE in MySQL/PostgreSQL)** to optimize performance.
