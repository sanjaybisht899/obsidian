## 1. System Architecture & Design

## **High-Level Architecture**

Vymo's system architecture is designed around microservices deployed in a modular fashion. Services are grouped into "mini monoliths" to optimize resource usage while maintaining modularity. These services interact via an API Gateway, which handles routing, authentication, and policy enforcement.

## **Microservices Interaction**

- Services register themselves in a Service Registry with configurations like service name, transport protocols (HTTP, Kafka), and policies.
    
- The API Gateway maps incoming requests to the appropriate service using the registry.
    
- Inter-service communication is facilitated through HTTP or Kafka, with a framework abstracting transport-specific details.
    

## **Event-Driven vs. Request-Response**

- HTTP-based services follow a request-response model.
    
- Kafka-based services use an event-driven approach for asynchronous processing.
    

## **Monolithic vs. Microservices**

The system employs a hybrid approach:

- Core services are microservices for scalability and modularity.
    
- Some cohesive functionalities are grouped into mini monoliths to save deployment resources.
    

## **Inter-Service Communication**

- Communication is handled via REST APIs for synchronous calls and Kafka for asynchronous messaging.
    
- A framework ensures transport-agnostic service invocation.
    

## **Scalability**

- Kubernetes auto-scaling ensures horizontal scaling based on load.
    
- Load balancers distribute traffic across instances.
    

## **High Availability & Fault Tolerance**

- Redundancy is built into the system with multiple instances of critical services.
    
- Kubernetes ensures failover by restarting failed pods.
    

## **Data Consistency**

- Eventual consistency is achieved using Kafka for asynchronous updates.
    
- Services rely on distributed transactions or compensating actions for critical workflows.
    

## **Caching Strategies**

- Caching layers are implemented at both API Gateway and service levels to reduce database load and improve response times.
    

## **API Versioning**

Versioning is handled through URL paths (e.g., `/v1/service`) to ensure backward compatibility.

## **Load Balancing**

Load balancers distribute traffic across service instances using round-robin or least-connections strategies.

## **Database Optimization**

- Indexing strategies are used to optimize query performance.
    
- Schema migrations are carefully managed to avoid downtime.
    

## 2. Deployment & CI/CD

## **CI/CD Pipeline Structure**

The pipeline includes:

1. Code build and unit testing.
    
2. Deployment to staging environments for integration testing.
    
3. Promotion to production after successful testing.
    

## **Deployment Process**

1. Feature branches are merged into staging branches.
    
2. Builds are created and deployed in staging environments for QA testing.
    
3. Approved builds are promoted to production.
    

## **Rollback Strategies**

Failed deployments can be rolled back using previous stable builds stored in the artifact repository.

## **Feature Releases**

Feature flags, blue-green deployments, and canary releases are used to manage feature rollouts incrementally.

## **Testing Strategies**

Automated unit, integration, and regression tests are run before deployment to ensure stability.

## 3. Kubernetes & Containerization

## **Microservices Deployment**

Services are containerized and deployed on Kubernetes clusters using Helm charts for configuration management.

## **Namespace Management**

Namespaces isolate environments (e.g., staging, production) and client-specific configurations.

## **Service Discovery**

Kubernetes' DNS-based service discovery allows services to locate each other dynamically within the cluster.

## **Ingress Controllers**

Nginx ingress controllers handle routing of external traffic to internal services based on URL paths or subdomains.

## **Persistent Storage**

Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) manage storage needs for stateful applications like databases.

## **Auto-scaling**

Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) scale services based on CPU/memory utilization metrics.

## 4. Database & Data Management

## **Multi-Tenant Databases**

Tenant isolation is achieved through schema separation or tenant IDs in shared databases.

## **Schema Migrations**

Migrations use tools like Liquibase or Flyway to ensure consistency across environments without downtime.

## **Performance Optimization**

Indexes and query optimization techniques improve database read/write performance.

## **Failover Handling**

Replication ensures high availability, with automatic failover mechanisms in place for primary database failures.

## 5. Logging & Monitoring

## **Logging Frameworks**

Centralized logging using ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack aggregates logs from all services for analysis.

## **Monitoring Tools**

Prometheus and Grafana monitor system health, while Sensu provides alerting capabilities for anomalies.

## 6. Security & Compliance

## **Authentication & Authorization**

OAuth2-compliant providers like Keycloak manage authentication. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) enforces fine-grained authorization policies.

## **API Security Measures**

API Gateway enforces rate limiting, JWT token validation, and secure communication via HTTPS/TLS protocols.

## **Data Encryption**

Data at rest is encrypted using AES standards, while data in transit uses TLS encryption.

## 7. Networking & Service Communication

## **Handling Failures**

Retries with exponential backoff handle transient failures in inter-service communication. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures during outages.

## **Messaging Queues**

Kafka handles asynchronous messaging between services for event-driven workflows.

## 8. Team Collaboration & Code Management

## **Branching Strategy**

Git Flow is used with feature branches merged into staging or master branches after code reviews and approvals.

## 9. Cost Optimization & Performance Tuning

## **Cloud Cost Optimization**

Unused resources are scaled down automatically during off-peak hours using Kubernetes' cluster autoscaler.
