### **Caching States**

Caching states define how data is stored, updated, and invalidated in a cache. Here are the key caching states:

1. **Fresh (Valid)** â€“ The cached data is up-to-date and can be served directly.
2. **Stale** â€“ The cached data has expired but can still be served while a new version is fetched in the background.
3. **Expired** â€“ The cached data is outdated and must be revalidated or replaced.
4. **Dirty (Modified)** â€“ The cached data has been updated locally but not written back to the main storage.
5. **Evicted** â€“ Data is removed from the cache to free space for new entries.
6. **Miss** â€“ The requested data is not in the cache, requiring retrieval from the main storage.
7. **Warm (Preloaded)** â€“ The cache is pre-filled with expected data to improve performance.

### **Example in Real Life**

- **Web Browsers**: Store static assets like images and CSS files.
- **Databases**: Use caching (e.g., Redis) to speed up queries.
- **CDNs**: Cache website content to reduce server load.

Would you like examples of how caching states work in Java or Spring Boot? ðŸš€
