Questions based in scaling?  
How will you handle this load?  
how will you scale your application?

**Design round:**  
It started with introduction and he straight came to design problem. He asked to design one system related to credit card with two requirement. First requirement was to notify the user at start of expiry month that card is gonna expire at end of month and second requirement was to expire the card itself and send notification to user that card got expired.  
I clarified is it HLD or LLD. He said let’s start with HLD.  
I started with listing these two functional requirements. Then I draw quite simple architectural diagram with couple of services. He cross-question in between about performance and I was able to tune it with discussions. In the end I was able to come up with good design interviewer was satisfied with.  
Interview was quite helpful in this round giving hints in between. Frankly speaking, this was my first ever HLD round.

**Round 2 ( Problem Solving ) (1 hr)**

- System Design
    - manage dependent cron jobs. ex: job1 depends upon job 2 and job 3 first needs to compplete job 3 and job 2 then we can start job1
    - interviewer asked low level logic
        - not much inforamtion given by interviewer about question.

R3: He asked me HLD and LLD of instagram with features like:

- user can make post, reply, comment, like on a post
- has a feed system(generated from latest posts of friends)
- follow unfollow friend

It was a very good discussion. I tried my best explaining him schema and what all DBs and APIs I will use. At many points he gave very good inputs. Although the problem is a very common one, but still I was feeling I am solving it first time.
