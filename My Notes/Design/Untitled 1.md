Sure! Letâ€™s break down **Vymoâ€™s architecture** step by step in a simple way.

---

### **1. Client Access & Public DNS**

- Users (on mobile or laptop) access **Vymoâ€™s LMS (Learning Management System)** via the URL:  
    **`client.lms.getvymo.com`**
- This domain is managed by **Public DNS (Route 53)**.

---

### **2. DC App Gateway (Traffic Control)**

- All user requests first go through **DC App Gateway**, which acts as a traffic controller.
- This ensures security and efficient routing.

---

### **3. Security & Load Balancing**

- **Reverse Proxy**: Filters & directs requests to the right microservice.
- **WAF (Web Application Firewall)**: Protects from security threats.
- **NSG (Network Security Group)**: Ensures only allowed network traffic passes through.
- **LB (Load Balancer)**: Distributes user requests across different microservices.

---

### **4. VNET-INTERNAL (Main Microservices)**

This section has **all the microservices** that power Vymo, including:

- **LMS**: Learning Management System
- **SSO**: Single Sign-On (authentication)
- **GEO**: Geolocation services
- **CONFIG**: Configuration management
- **CALENDAR**: Scheduling and meetings
- **SELF-SERVE**: User self-service options
- **ETL**: Data processing & extraction
- **GOALS**: Goal management
- **NOTIFICATIONS**: Sending alerts & updates

These services work **independently** but communicate as needed.

---

### **5. VNET-EXTERNAL (Client Integration)**

- **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** & **LMS** are accessible externally.
- **SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)**: Used for secure file transfers between Vymo and clients.

---

### **6. VNET-DATABASES (Data Storage & Processing)**

This section holds **all databases & backend services**, including:

- **SQL & MongoDB**: Relational & NoSQL databases.
- **Zookeeper**: Manages configurations & service coordination.
- **Kafka**: Handles event streaming & real-time data processing.
- **Elasticsearch**: Enables fast searching capabilities.
- **Vertica**: Stores analytical & business intelligence data.

---

### **7. VNET-BASTION (Security & Monitoring)**

- **Bastion**: A secure gateway to access internal servers.
- **Prometheus**: Used for system monitoring.
- **Sensu**: Helps in health checks & alerts.

---

### **8. CLIENT (External Integrations)**

Vymo integrates with external client systems:

- **CRM**: Customer data management.
- **AD (Active Directory)**: Manages authentication.
- **SFTP**: Secure file transfers.
- **LDAP**: Directory service for authentication.
- **API**: Connects Vymo to external applications.

---

### **How Everything Works Together?**

1. A user accesses `client.lms.getvymo.com`.
2. The request is routed via **DC App Gateway** to the right microservice.
3. The microservice communicates with **databases** or **external systems** as needed.
4. The response is processed and sent back securely.

---

This architecture ensures: âœ… **Scalability** (Microservices can be independently managed)  
âœ… **Security** (WAF, NSG, and Bastion protect the system)  
âœ… **Performance** (Load Balancer & Kafka optimize efficiency)
