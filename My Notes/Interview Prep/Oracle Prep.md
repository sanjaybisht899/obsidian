**1st Technical round:**  
Intro about me  
What do you know about Java? Why is it popular?  
Some standard CS questions were asked:  
What is OOP?  
Explain Encapsulation with an example.  
Explain Polymorphism, exception handling.  
Then, we had a discussion on the projects that were on my resume. This took most of the time of the interview so I was not asked any dsa problem to solve. My friend was asked some Easy LC problem in this round.

Round-2 (Technical Round)  
Please note that I have not revealed exact DSA question which was asked in Technical round due to NDA (Non Disclosure Agreement) and have tried to explain a similar question to one asked in interview.

2)[https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

similar question asked in a interview. and this was conducted in hackerearth code pair

Technical Round 1: The first technical round started with the interviewer asking me to introduce myself. They inquired about the projects mentioned in my resume deeply and then presented a Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) question related to strings and maps. Additionally, I was asked to write SQL queries and discuss object-oriented programming concepts like classes, polymorphism, and inheritance along with their codes. This round had a duration of 40–45 minutes.

Due to large number of candidates shortlisted for interviews, each interviewer was handling 2-3  
candidates simultaneously . He directly fired different coding questions on us without wasting even a second. I was given to implement next_permutation() function of c++ and the other student was asked about the excel sheet problem [http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-excel-column-name-givennumber/](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-excel-column-name-givennumber/).  
After this round I was told to wait outside. Another interviewer was present there and he quickly  
asked me 2 more coding questions [http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-product-array-puzzle/) and the  
other question was - given a paragraph find which alphabet doesn’t occur in it. The key to this roundwas to give simple, quick and optimal solution wrt time and space. A normal solution led to direct exit from this round without any deliberations.

**Loop 1 : (Coding and System Design)**

I was given this question for the coding round.

```
Write functionality that compares two given inputs and prints out what was changed. 
 Each input can be of composite data type.
 Inputs:
 input 1: {‘name’:’Oracle’, ‘address’:{‘country’:’USA’, ‘state’:’CA’, ‘Area’:’redwood shores’}, 'stock':'ORCL'}
 input 2: {‘name’:’Oracle’, ‘address’:{‘country’:’USA’, ‘state’:’TX’, ‘Area’:’redwood shores’, ‘zip’:79004}}
 Output:
 Print what is added, removed, modified and the same.
 Added: 'zip':79004 to 'address'
 Changed: 'state' to ’TX'
 Removed: 'stock'
```

Wrote the solution in Java. Could have completed earlier if I had chosen javascript as the question can be easily done in javascript. Coded the working solution within time in Java using Map instead of JSON.

The interviewer skipped the handling of Arrays in json for the sake of time.

Had a system design as a second part in this round itself.

Question : Design an Automatic scaling service.

Screwed this up. Explained the server logic behind the Scaling UP and Scaling Down. But Didn’t come up with what the interviewer was expecting from me as this was my first system design interview. Later the interviewer asked me to explain the last design that I did in my projects.

**2. Technical Interview - 1** _(DSA oriented) (45-mins)_

1. First question was to make me comfortable, he asked how my day had gone so far and how the pre-placement talk went. Do you find anything exciting in Oracle?
    
2. After that the interviewer introduced himself. Also asked me to introduce myself and open the hackerrank link that he has shared with me.
    
3. 1st coding problem - You are given a string ‘s’, return true or false if there exists any permutation of the given string ‘s’ which is palindrome.  
    I discussed brute-force way to generate all permutations of the string and check if it is a palindrome or not. Next I discussed the approach using hashmap. Solved the problem and dry run test cases that were given by him.  
    As I have used Hashmap in previous questions, he asked some questions related to hashmap. Why have you used unordered_map? What is the difference between map and unordered_map? How are they internally implemented? What is chaining and linear probing?
    
4. 2nd coding problem - Given a singly linked list and a pointer of any node, Delete that node from singly linked list. Is it possible to delete the last node from the singly linked list?
    
5. 3rd coding problem - Find the starting node of the cycle in a singly linked list.
    

Solved all three problems and tested it on the hackerrank editor.

**Round 2 Technical Interview**  
I was asked to explain the approach and why for both the problems and was given a slight modification in test cases in one of the problems but I don't remember it actually now. After that I was asked this problem :  
_There are two data sets consisting of random numbers from 1 to 50K in one array and 1 to 60K in another array. I have with me only an array of size 10 and I have to sort both the arrays 50K + 60K resulting in an array os 110K elements which are to be sorted in ascending order._  
I told them that I can use a sliding window to try and sort the elements, but I did not know how to implement it nor did i know if the approach was right. I however explained to him that I can sort the 50K and 60K arrays in-place using quicksort and can combine them using the logic of mergesort. I explained both of the sorting algos to the interview. He told it's okay if I didn't know the solution to this and we moved on.  
Next he asked a couple of questions on sql , used a sample Employee table and asked questions using joins, subqueries and filter using where clause. A problem where I should GroupBy using primary key.
