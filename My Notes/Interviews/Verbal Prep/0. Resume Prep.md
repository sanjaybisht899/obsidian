## **Implementing Internationalization (i18n) in Showman: A Journey of Problem-Solving**

At Vymo, one of the major challenges we faced was ensuring a seamless experience for our diverse client base, spanning multiple geographies and industries. While our mobile application already had i18n support, the demo data used by our pre-sales team lacked localization, making it difficult to showcase a truly localized product experience to potential clients.

To bridge this gap, I took the initiative to develop **Showman**, an internal tool built using **React**, designed to generate and push structured lead data dynamically. This tool became a game-changer for our pre-sales team, enabling them to present data tailored to different geographies and industries such as **banks, insurance firms, and agencies**. However, implementing i18n support within Showman came with its own set of technical and architectural challenges.

---

### **The Core Problem: Non-Localized Demo Data**

The pre-sales team needed data that reflected real-world business scenarios for different clients. Previously, they had to **manually create demo data**, which was a slow and error-prone process. Moreover, since the existing system lacked **dynamic localization support**, data was often mismatched with the client’s locale, leading to an inconsistent user experience during demos.

For instance, if a sales demo was being conducted for a **client in Japan**, but the lead names, addresses, and business terminologies were in **English**, it would feel unnatural. Similarly, clients in **Mumbai** expected local addresses, phone number formats, and regional terminologies.

---

### **Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented**

#### **1. Handling Locale-Specific Data Generation**

**Problem:** The biggest challenge was ensuring that the generated data was relevant to the selected locale. A simple translation wouldn’t work; we needed real-world data that aligned with the geography.

**Solution:** I implemented a **locale-based data generation system**, where users could select a region (e.g., Mumbai, Tokyo, New York), and the tool would:

- Fetch **region-specific lead names**, business names, and contact details.
- Automatically **adjust date formats**, currency, and address structures based on the locale.
- Support **proximity-based filtering**, allowing users to specify a target area and generate data accordingly.

---

#### **2. Managing Large-Scale API Calls Efficiently**

**Problem:** Since the tool had to fetch data dynamically for multiple clients across different industries, we had to make multiple API calls, leading to performance bottlenecks.

**Solution:** To optimize this, I:

- **Implemented caching mechanisms** to store frequently used data, reducing redundant API calls.
- Used **batch processing** to minimize the number of requests being made at once.
- Introduced **asynchronous API handling** to prevent UI lag and ensure a smooth user experience.

---

#### **3. Supporting Multiple Data Structures Based on Industry**

**Problem:** Different industries had different requirements. A **banking client** needed financial transaction records, while an **insurance client** needed policy details. The challenge was to dynamically structure the data based on the client’s industry.

**Solution:** I designed a **flexible schema system** where:

- The user could select the industry, and Showman would **automatically structure the data accordingly**.
- Data templates were pre-defined for each industry but could also be customized dynamically.
- This ensured that banks received bank-related data, insurance companies received policyholder information, and so on.

---

#### **4. Integrating React for a Seamless User Experience**

Since the internal tool was built in **React**, one of my goals was to ensure a smooth and intuitive UI.

- Implemented a **dropdown-based locale selection**, making it easy for users to switch between different regions.
- Used **React Query** for efficient state management and data fetching.
- Added **real-time validation** to ensure that the generated data matched the selected locale and industry standards.

---

### **Final Impact & Business Value**

- **80% Reduction in Manual Work** – The pre-sales team no longer had to create demo data manually, saving them hours of effort.
- **Increased Sales Conversion** – By showcasing highly relevant, localized data, clients could better relate to the product, leading to improved engagement.
- **Scalability & Reusability** – The tool was designed to be easily extendable, allowing support for more regions and industries in the future.

---

### **Conclusion**

Implementing i18n support in Showman was not just about translating text; it was about creating a truly localized experience. By solving key challenges such as **dynamic locale-based data generation, optimizing API calls, and handling industry-specific structures**, we were able to enhance Vymo’s sales demos, making them more impactful and engaging for potential clients worldwide.

## AI-Powered Call Analysis for Next-Best Action Predictions

**Built an AI-driven call analysis feature using OpenAI and Kafka for real-time next-best action predictions, improving sales efficiency.**


**AI-Powered Call Analysis for Next-Best Action Predictions**

Every year, **Forrester hosts a major sales tech event** where top companies showcase innovations. Our team saw this as an opportunity to present a **cutting-edge AI-driven call analysis feature** to enhance our existing **lead suggestion service**.

At Vymo, we already provided **lead recommendations** based on historical data, but we wanted to **elevate this** by integrating **real-time call insights**, enabling sales reps to receive **instant, actionable suggestions** based on live conversations.

**The Challenge: Bringing AI into Call Analysis**

Our goals were:

1. Capture and process **real-time call data**.
2. Extract meaningful **insights from conversations**.
3. Provide **instant AI-generated suggestions** to sales reps.
4. Handle **high-volume traffic** without system slowdowns.

---
We faced **two major constraints**:

• **Scalability:** Ensuring low-latency responses as data volumes increased.
• **Reliability:** Preventing system failures while handling thousands of requests per second.

---

**Step 1: Call Capture & Transcription**

  
Since direct phone calls **can’t be recorded**, we integrated **Exotel** for **call tracking and recording.

To **process and transcribe calls**, we used:

• **Amazon S3** to securely store audio recordings.
• **AWS Transcribe / Google Speech-to-Text APIs** for converting calls into structured text.

These transcripts were then **fed into OpenAI** for intelligent analysis.

---

**Step 2: AI-Driven Insights with OpenAI**

We needed **precise next-best action predictions**, so we sent the **call transcript** along with the **lead’s historical data** to **OpenAI** for analysis.

To **improve AI accuracy**, we:

• **Adjusted Temperature Control**: Prevented overly random AI responses.
• **Implemented Custom Mapping**: Ensured AI recommendations were aligned with lead context.
• **Defined Strict API Constraints**: Prevented irrelevant or misleading suggestions.

OpenAI then returned a **structured JSON response**, suggesting actions like **sending a document, scheduling a follow-up, or updating the lead’s status**.

| **Parameter**                | **Purpose**                                                    | **Configuration Used**                                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model**                    | Defines the AI model used for processing                       | gpt-4 or gpt-3.5-turbo                                     |
| **Temperature**              | Controls randomness (lower = more deterministic)               | 0.2 - 0.3 (to maintain precise responses)                  |
| **Max Tokens**               | Limits the response length                                     | Adjusted based on call context                             |
| **Top-P (Nucleus Sampling)** | Alternative to temperature (controls probability distribution) | 0.8 - 0.9 (for slightly diverse responses)                 |
| **Frequency Penalty**        | Reduces repetition of words or phrases                         | 0.3 - 0.5                                                  |
| **Presence Penalty**         | Encourages introducing new concepts if needed                  | 0.0 - 0.2                                                  |
| **System Message**           | Provides initial instructions to the model                     | Used to **guide AI responses** towards structured insights |
| **Stop Sequences**           | Prevents AI from generating unnecessary text                   | Defined custom stop words to **end responses cleanly**     |

**Step 3: Real-Time Suggestion Processing via Kafka**

**Why Not Use a Simple REST API?**

  Initially, we considered using **REST APIs** to send suggestions from the **Suggestion Service** to the **Lead Service**, but it caused:

• **Scalability issues** due to synchronous API calls.
• **High latency** when handling bulk requests.
• **System failures** if the Lead Service was temporarily unavailable.

**Solution: Kafka for Event-Driven Processing**

To resolve this, we integrated **Kafka**, which allowed us to:
✅ **Asynchronously queue messages**, preventing overload.
✅ **Scale effortlessly**, handling thousands of concurrent requests.
✅ **Ensure fault tolerance**, as messages are retained even if a service fails.
✅ **Enable real-time event streaming**, allowing multiple consumers (e.g., reporting services) to **process suggestions simultaneously**.

By adopting **Kafka over REST**, we **eliminated bottlenecks** and ensured a **highly scalable, resilient, and low-latency system**.

**Final Impact**

✔ **Enabled real-time AI-driven call insights**, improving lead conversion rates.
✔ **Reduced response latency** by replacing REST with **Kafka-based streaming**.
✔ **Automated next-best action predictions**, helping sales teams make better decisions.
✔ **Showcased AI innovation at Forrester**, securing multiple enterprise clients.
