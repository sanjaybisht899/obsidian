Hi, I’m Sanjay.

Currently, I work at **Vymo Technologies**, its a B2B SaaS company that creates **AI-based sales solutions for financial institutions**.  

So Basically Vymo is a platform which is used by the sales where they can perform actions on the lead, create activities, update leads & cover the  lead journey from the onboarding till the  conversion & we provide them with suggestions and next best actions to help them convert their leads more effectively.  

In Vymo I'm working with the customer engineering team
- Design and develop new features & fix the existing bugs

- Delivered **10+ custom demos** for clients under tight deadlines, out of which **3-4 got converted**, generating **$150K in monthly revenue**.  
- Created **internal tools and workflows** that increased developer productivity by **50%**.  
- And those internal tools are being used by **pre-sales teams** which has reduced their manual effort by **30%**, saving time and improving efficiency.  

**Before Vymo**, I worked at **TechMahindra** in the **telecom domain**:  
- **Developed applications** using Java, Spring Boot, and React, improving system efficiency.
