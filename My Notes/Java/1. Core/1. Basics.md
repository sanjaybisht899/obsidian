### 1. **What is Java?**

Java is a popular programming language known for being:

- **Object-Oriented**: Focused on creating reusable objects in code.
- **Platform-Independent**: Java code runs on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
- **Secure**: Provides built-in security features to protect against threats.
- **Robust**: Handles errors effectively using exceptions.
- **Multithreaded**: Supports running multiple tasks simultaneously.

#### Key Features:

- **Simple**: Easy to learn with clear syntax.
- **Portable**: Code can move across platforms without needing changes.
- **High Performance**: JIT compiler optimizes the performance.

### 2. **JDK, JRE, and JVM**

Java operates using three main components:
#### **Java Development Kit (JDK)**

- A **developer's toolkit** that includes tools like a compiler, debugger, and libraries to write and compile Java programs.
- Contains **JRE + Development Tools**.

#### **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**

- Provides the environment needed to run Java programs.
- Includes **JVM + Libraries** to execute the bytecode.

#### **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**

- A virtual engine that converts Java **bytecode** into machine code specific to the underlying operating system.
- Manages memory and execution.

### 3. **How Java is Platform-Independent**

Java achieves platform independence using the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** and the **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**:

1. Developers write Java code and compile it into **bytecode** using the `javac` compiler.
2. This **bytecode** is universal and can run on any machine with a compatible **JRE** 
3. The **JVM** translates bytecode into machine-specific instructions for execution.

This is why Java is known as **"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)**.

### 4. **How JVM Works**

1. **Write & Compile**:
    - You write Java code (`.java` file).
    - `javac` compiler converts it into **bytecode** (`.class` file).
2. **Class Loader**:
    - Loads the bytecode into the JVM.
    - Ensures the code is safe and valid.
3. **Execution Engine**:
    - **Interpreter**: Converts bytecode to machine instructions line by line.
    - **JIT Compiler**: Speeds up execution by converting frequently used bytecode into native machine code.
4. **Garbage Collection**:    
    - JVM automatically removes unused objects from memory.


---

### 5. **JIT Compiler**

The **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler** is a part of the **JVM Execution Engine** that improves the performance of Java applications by converting frequently used bytecode into **native machine code** during runtime.

---

1. **Starts with the Interpreter**:
    
    - Initially, the JVM interprets bytecode line by line.
2. **Identifies "Hot Code"**:
    
    - The JIT compiler identifies code that is executed repeatedly (called "hotspots").
3. **Compiles to Native Code**:
    
    - Converts this "hot code" into optimized machine code (specific to the system's architecture).
4. **Speeds Up Execution**:
    
    - The native code runs faster because it skips interpretation for those parts.

---

### 6. **Java ClassLoader**

- Responsible for loading class files into the JVM.
- **Types of ClassLoaders**:
    - **Bootstrap ClassLoader**: Loads core Java classes.
    - **Extension ClassLoader**: Loads classes from the `ext` directory.
    - **Application ClassLoader**: Loads classes from the application's classpath.

---

### 7. **Java's `main` Method**

- The entry point of any Java program:
    
    ```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Code goes here
    }
    ```
    

#### Why is `main` defined this way?

- **`public`**: Accessible from anywhere.
- **`static`**: Doesn't need an object to be invoked.
- **`void`**: Doesn't return any value.
- **`String[] args`**: Used to accept command-line arguments.

---

### 8. **Important Notes about the `main` Method**

- **`main` is not a keyword**: It's just the name of the method.
- You **cannot write `public void static`**: The order of modifiers matters; it must be `public static void`.
- If you run the program **without arguments**, the `args` array will be empty but not null.

---

### 9. **Local Variables in Java**

- Local variables are declared inside methods or blocks.
- **No default value** is assigned to local variables. You must initialize them before use. For example:
    
    ```java
    int x; // Error: x is not initialized
    ```
    

---

### 10. **Default Values for Class Variables**

Unlike local variables, class variables (instance or static) get default values:

- Numeric types: `0` or `0.0`
- `char`: `'\u0000'` (null character)
- `boolean`: `false`
- Object references: `null`
