### **Difference Between `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer`**

|Feature|`String`|`StringBuilder`|`StringBuffer`|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Mutability**|Immutable|Mutable|Mutable|
|**Thread Safety**|Thread-safe (because immutable)|Not thread-safe|Thread-safe (synchronized methods)|
|**Performance**|Slow (new object created for each modification)|Fast (no synchronization overhead)|Slower than `StringBuilder` (due to synchronization)|
|**Memory Usage**|High (since every modification creates a new object)|Efficient (modifies same object)|Efficient but slightly slower due to thread safety overhead|
|**Synchronization**|Not required|Not synchronized|Synchronized (Safe for multi-threading)|
|**Usage**|Use when string manipulation is minimal or security is needed|Use when multiple modifications are required but thread safety is not a concern|Use when multiple modifications are required and thread safety is needed|

## **Internal Working of `StringBuffer`**

`StringBuffer` is implemented internally using a **char array**. It maintains a **capacity** that grows dynamically when needed.

### **Key Internal Concepts:**

1. **Underlying Array:**
    
    - `StringBuffer` uses a `char[]` internally.
    - Initially, the array has a default capacity of `16` characters (unless specified).
2. **Capacity Expansion:**
    
    - When appending new characters, if the existing array is full, a **new larger array** is created.
    - The new capacity = `(old capacity * 2) + 2` (i.e., it doubles and adds 2).
3. **Thread Safety:**
    
    - All public methods of `StringBuffer` are **synchronized** to ensure **thread safety**.

---

### **Example: Internal Working**

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");
```

- Internally, it creates a **char array**:
    
    ```java
    char[] value = new char[16];  // Default capacity of 16
    ```
    
- When `"Hello"` is assigned, the array stores:
    
    ```
    ['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0', '\0', ...]  // Remaining spaces are empty
    ```
    

---

### **Capacity Growth Example**

```java
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(5); // Initial capacity: 5
sb.append("Hello");  // No expansion needed
sb.append(" World"); // Capacity exceeded -> New array created
```

- **New Capacity Calculation:**
    
    ```
    New capacity = (Old Capacity * 2) + 2
                 = (5 * 2) + 2
                 = 12
    ```
    
- A new array of **12** characters is created, and the old contents are copied.

---

### **Conclusion**

- `StringBuffer` is a **mutable, thread-safe alternative** to `String`.
- It **avoids excessive object creation**, making it **more memory-efficient** than `String`.
- However, **`StringBuilder` is faster** than `StringBuffer` when thread safety is not required.

### **Question:**

How many objects will be created in the following Java code?

```java
String s = "sanjay";
String s2 = "sanjay";
String s3 = new String("sanjay");
String s4 = new String("sanjay");
String s5 = s3.intern();
String s6 = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4;
```

---

### **Answer:**

Let's analyze step by step:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **String Literals (Stored in the String Pool)**

```java
String s = "sanjay";
String s2 = "sanjay";
```

- The literal `"sanjay"` is stored in the **String Pool**.
- Both `s` and `s2` point to the **same object** in the pool.
- **Objects Created: 1 (String Pool)**

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Using `new String()` (Stored in Heap Memory)**

```java
String s3 = new String("sanjay");
String s4 = new String("sanjay");
```

- `new String("sanjay")` creates a **new object in Heap**.
- So, `s3` and `s4` each create a **separate object** in the Heap.
- **Objects Created: 2 (Heap Memory)**

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Using `intern()`**

```java
String s5 = s3.intern();
```

- `s3.intern()` returns the reference of `"sanjay"` from the **String Pool**.
- `s5` now refers to the same object as `s` and `s2`.
- **Objects Created: 0 (No new object, just reference assignment)**

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ **String Concatenation**

```java
String s6 = s1 + s2 + s3 + s4;
```

- Since `s1`, `s2`, `s3`, and `s4` are **variables** (not compile-time constants), Java creates a **new string in Heap**.
- Temporary variable is created for doing the calculation which is done through 
- **Objects Created: 1 (Heap Memory)**

---

### **Final Count**

| Object Type                   | Created In                               | Count |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----- |
| **String Literal `"sanjay"`** | String Pool                              | 1     |
| **Heap Objects (s3, s4)**     | Heap                                     | 2     |
| **Concatenated String (s6)**  | Heap                                     | 1     |
| **`intern()` result (s5)**    | No new object (reference to String Pool) | 0     |
| **Total Objects Created**     | **4** + 1 Temporary Object               |       |

### **Why is `String` Immutable in Java?**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Security** üîí

- `String` is widely used for storing sensitive data like passwords, file paths, and URLs.
- If `String` were mutable, attackers could modify these values, leading to security vulnerabilities.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **String Pool Optimization** üèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- Java stores string literals in a **String Pool** to save memory.
- If `String` were mutable, modifying one string would change all references, breaking consistency.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Thread-Safety** ‚ö°

- Since `String` cannot change, multiple threads can use the same object without synchronization.
- This makes it **automatically thread-safe**, avoiding race conditions.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **HashCode Caching** üöÄ

- `String` objects are commonly used as **keys in HashMaps**.
- Since their value doesn't change, their **hashcode is computed once** and reused, improving performance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Prevents Unintended Changes** ‚ùå

- When passing `String` as a method argument, changes inside the method don‚Äôt affect the original string.
- This avoids unexpected modifications and ensures consistency.
