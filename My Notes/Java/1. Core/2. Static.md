### **1. What is Static in Java?**

The `static` keyword in Java is used to create variables and methods that belong to the **class** rather than a specific object. It enables sharing of a single instance of a variable or method across all objects of the class.

#### Features of `static`:

1. **Shared Memory**: Static variables are shared across all objects of a class.
2. **Class-Level Access**: Static methods and variables can be accessed without creating an object of the class.

---

### **2. Static Variables**

A **static variable** is a class-level variable that retains its value across all objects.

#### Why Use Static Variables?

- To store **common data** for all objects of a class (e.g., a counter to count objects).

#### Example:

```java
class Counter {
    static int count = 0; // Static variable
    Counter() {
        count++;
    }
}
```

Here, `count` is shared across all `Counter` objects.

#### Why is it not a good practice to create static variables?

- **Tight Coupling**: Static variables introduce dependencies between different parts of the program.
- **Thread Safety Issues**: When multiple threads access static variables, it can lead to inconsistent states.
- **Memory Retention**: Static variables persist for the lifetime of the program, potentially causing **memory leaks**.

---

### **3. Static Methods**

A **static method** belongs to the class rather than an instance. It can be called using the class name, without creating an object.

#### Purpose of Static Methods:

- To perform operations that do not depend on instance variables (e.g., utility methods).

#### Example:

```java
class Utility {
    static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // No instance variables are used
    }
}
```

Usage:

```java
int result = Utility.add(5, 10);
```

### **4. Why is the `main()` Method Marked Static?**

The `main()` method is marked `static` because:

1. **Direct Access**: JVM can invoke it without creating an object of the class.
2. **Entry Point**: It acts as the starting point of a Java program.
3. **No Object Dependency**: `main()` is independent of the class’s state.

---

### **5. Static Block**

A **static block** is a block of code that gets executed **only once** when the class is loaded into memory.

#### Purpose:

- To **initialize static variables**.
- To perform setup tasks that need to be executed before the class is used.

#### Example:

```java
class Example {
    static int value;
    static {
        value = 10; // Static block initializes the static variable
        System.out.println("Static block executed.");
    }
}
```

#### When to Use:

- When initialization logic cannot be done in a single line.

### **6. Executing a Program Without `main()` Method**

It is **not possible** to execute a Java program without a `main()` method in modern versions of Java. However:

- Prior to Java 7, a static block could execute code without `main()`:
    
    ```java
    static {
        System.out.println("Program executed.");
        System.exit(0);
    }
    ```
    
    This approach is no longer allowed in newer versions.

---

### **7. What Happens if `main()` Is Not Static?**

If `main()` is not declared static, the JVM will not be able to execute it directly. It will result in a **runtime error**.

---

### **8. Static Method vs. Instance Method**

|**Static Method**|**Instance Method**|
|---|---|
|Belongs to the class.|Belongs to an instance of the class.|
|Can be called without creating an object.|Requires an object to be called.|
|Cannot access non-static (instance) variables.|Can access both static and instance variables.|
|Example: `Math.max(a, b)`.|Example: `objectName.instanceMethod()`.|

---

### **9. Example of Static in Real-Life Context**

Imagine a university with multiple students:

- **Static Variable**: A static variable like `universityName` would store the name of the university, as it is common to all students.
- **Static Method**: A method like `getUniversityDetails()` could return information about the university without needing to know details of individual students.
- **Instance Method**: Methods like `getStudentDetails()` would require a specific student’s data.

```java
class University {
    static String universityName = "ABC University"; // Shared by all
    String studentName;

    University(String name) {
        this.studentName = name;
    }

    static String getUniversityDetails() {
        return universityName; // No object required
    }

    String getStudentDetails() {
        return "Student: " + studentName; // Requires instance
    }
}
```

### **Where Static Is Stored**:

1. **Class Memory / Method Area**:
    
    - **Static Fields**: These are variables that belong to the class, not to any particular instance. They are stored in the **static memory** of the class.
    - **Static Methods**: These are methods that belong to the class and can be called without creating an object. The method’s bytecode is stored in the **static part** of the class.
2. **Heap Memory**:
    
    - If the **static fields** hold references to objects, those objects themselves are stored in **heap memory**.
