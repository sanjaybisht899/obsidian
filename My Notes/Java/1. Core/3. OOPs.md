### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around **objects**—instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). It allows you to design programs that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.

---

### 2. **Key Principles of OOP**

OOP is based on four main principles:

1. **Encapsulation**:
    
    - Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) inside a class.
    - **Example**: Protecting class variables by declaring them private and providing public getter/setter methods.
2. **Inheritance**:
    
    - Mechanism where one class (child) acquires properties and behaviors from another class (parent).
    - **Example**: A `Car` class can inherit properties from a `Vehicle` class.
3. **Polymorphism**:
    
    - Ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
    - **Example**: A method `drive()` behaves differently for a `Car` object and a `Bike` object.
4. **Abstraction**:
    
    - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
    - **Example**: Using interfaces to define behaviors without specifying how they work.

### **Class**:

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data structure that holds state (variables) and behavior (methods). A class specifies what properties and actions an object of that type will have, but it does not create any actual objects by itself.

**Example**: A `Car` class defines properties like `color`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

### **Object**:

An **object** is an instance of a class. It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class. When an object is created, it holds actual values for the properties and can execute the behaviors (methods) defined by the class.

**Example**: An actual car object like `myCar` can have `color = "Red"`, `model = "Tesla"`, and `year = 2020`, and it can perform actions like `start()` and `stop()`.

In summary:

- A **class** defines properties and methods.
- An **object** is an actual instance of that class with specific values.

### 3. **Object-Oriented vs. Object-Based Programming Languages**

| **Object-Oriented**                                                                  | **Object-Based**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supports all OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction). | Supports Encapsulation but not Inheritance or Polymorphism. |
| Example: Java, C++, Python                                                           | Example: JavaScript (prior to ES6)                          |

---

### 4. **Default Value of Object Reference in an Instance Variable**

- If an object reference is declared as an instance variable but not initialized, its default value is `null`.

---

### 5. **Constructors in Java**

#### What is a Constructor?

- A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
- It has the same name as the class and no return type.

#### Why Do We Need a Constructor?

- To initialize an object with default or specific values.  
    **Example**:
    
    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;
    
        // Constructor
        Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
    ```
    

#### What is a Default Constructor?

- A default constructor is a no-argument constructor provided by Java if no other constructors are defined.
- **Why Do We Need It?**: If no constructors exist, the default constructor ensures that objects can still be created.

---

### 6. **Value Returned by a Constructor**

- A constructor **does not return any value**, not even `void`. Instead, it initializes the object and returns the new instance of the object implicitly.

---

### 7. **Can We Inherit a Constructor?**

- **No**, constructors are not inherited in Java. However, a subclass can call a parent class constructor using the `super()` keyword.

---

### 8. **Why Can’t Constructors Be `final`, `static`, or `abstract`?**

#### **Final Constructor**:

- The `final` keyword in Java is used to **prevent method overriding** or **class inheritance**.
- However, **constructors** are specifically designed to **initialize objects** when instances are created.
- Since constructors **cannot be overridden** (you cannot extend a class and change the constructor), the `final` keyword is **not applicable** to constructors.
- Attempting to declare a constructor as `final` will result in a **compilation error**.

#### **Static Constructor**:

- A `static` method belongs to the class, not to an instance. A constructor is inherently tied to an object, so making it `static` is contradictory.
- Trying to declare a constructor as static will result in a **compilation error**.

#### **Abstract Constructor**:

- An `abstract` method is incomplete and must be overridden. A constructor is complete and initializes objects, so making it `abstract` is illogical.

#### **Final Constructor**:

- **Constructors cannot be `final`** because they are not meant to be overridden or inherited.

# Questions

* How to make a class immutable?
	* 1. **Declare the class as `final`:** This ensures the class cannot be extended.
	2. **Make all fields `private` and `final`:** Prevents direct access and ensures the values are set only once.
	3. **Do not provide setters:** This avoids modifying the fields after the object is created.
	4. **Initialize all fields through the constructor:** Set the values of all fields when the object is created.
	5. **Perform deep copies for mutable objects:** If the class contains fields that reference mutable objects, return a deep copy instead of the original object.
---
### **Why Constructors Cannot Be Overridden:**

1. **Constructors are not inherited**:
    
    - Constructors are not inherited by subclasses like regular methods. Each class has its own constructor that is used to initialize objects of that class.
    - Although a subclass can **call** a parent class constructor using the `super()` keyword, this is not the same as **overriding** the constructor.
2. **Constructor is tied to object creation**:
    
    - A constructor is a special method used specifically for **creating objects**. It is tied to the class itself and not to instances in the same way regular methods are.
    - **Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. Since constructors are not inherited, they cannot be overridden.

---

### **Coupling and Cohesion**

#### **1. Coupling**
- **Definition**: Coupling refers to the **degree of dependency** between two classes or modules.
- **Types**:
  - **Tight Coupling**: Classes are highly dependent on each other. Changes in one class may require changes in another.
  - **Loose Coupling**: Classes are independent of each other. Changes in one class have minimal or no impact on another.

#### **2. Cohesion**
- **Definition**: Cohesion refers to how **focused and related** the responsibilities of a single class or module are.
- **Types**:
  - **High Cohesion**: A class has a single, well-defined purpose.
  - **Low Cohesion**: A class handles multiple unrelated tasks.

---

### **How to Achieve Loose Coupling**
1. **Use Interfaces or Abstract Classes**:
   - Depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations.
   - Example:
     ```java
     interface Engine {
         void start();
     }

     class Car {
         private Engine engine;
         public Car(Engine engine) { // Dependency injection
             this.engine = engine;
         }
         public void startCar() {
             engine.start();
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Pass dependencies (e.g., objects) to a class from the outside rather than creating them inside the class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     class PetrolEngine implements Engine {
         public void start() {
             System.out.println("Petrol Engine started.");
         }
     }

     class DieselEngine implements Engine {
         public void start() {
             System.out.println("Diesel Engine started.");
         }
     }

     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Engine petrolEngine = new PetrolEngine();
             Car car = new Car(petrolEngine); // Inject dependency
             car.startCar();
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Follow the Law of Demeter**:
   - A class should only interact with its immediate dependencies, not with the dependencies of its dependencies.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Bad: Tight coupling
     class Car {
         private Engine engine;
         public void startCar() {
             engine.getStarter().start(); // Violates Law of Demeter
         }
     }

     // Good: Loose coupling
     class Car {
         private Engine engine;
         public void startCar() {
             engine.start(); // Only interacts with immediate dependency
         }
     }
     ```

---

### **How to Achieve High Cohesion**
1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   - A class should have only **one reason to change** (i.e., one responsibility).
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Bad: Low cohesion
     class Report {
         public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
         public void saveToFile() { /* ... */ }
         public void printReport() { /* ... */ }
     }

     // Good: High cohesion
     class ReportGenerator {
         public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
     }

     class ReportSaver {
         public void saveToFile() { /* ... */ }
     }

     class ReportPrinter {
         public void printReport() { /* ... */ }
     }
     ```

2. **Group Related Methods**:
   - Keep methods that are related to the same functionality in the same class.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Good: High cohesion
     class Calculator {
         public int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
         public int subtract(int a, int b) { return a - b; }
         public int multiply(int a, int b) { return a * b; }
     }
     ```

3. **Avoid God Classes**:
   - A "God Class" is a class that does too much. Break it into smaller, more focused classes.
   - Example:
     ```java
     // Bad: God class
     class UserManager {
         public void createUser() { /* ... */ }
         public void deleteUser() { /* ... */ }
         public void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
         public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
     }

     // Good: High cohesion
     class UserService {
         public void createUser() { /* ... */ }
         public void deleteUser() { /* ... */ }
     }

     class EmailService {
         public void sendEmail() { /* ... */ }
     }

     class ReportService {
         public void generateReport() { /* ... */ }
     }
     ```

# Some Principles 
## **Component Cohesion Principles**

### **1. REP – The Reuse/Release Equivalence Principle**
- **Definition**: Classes or modules grouped into a component should be **reusable together** and released as a single unit.
- **Goal**: Ensure the component is useful and reusable as a whole.
- **Example**:
  - A `logging` component should include all classes related to logging (e.g., `Logger`, `LogFormatter`, `LogWriter`).

---

### **2. CCP – The Common Closure Principle**
- **Definition**: Classes or modules that **change for the same reason** should be grouped into the same component.
- **Goal**: Minimize the impact of changes by localizing them to a single component.
- **Example**:
  - A `payment` component should include all classes related to payment processing (e.g., `PaymentGateway`, `PaymentValidator`, `PaymentProcessor`).

---

### **3. CRP – The Common Reuse Principle**
- **Definition**: Classes or modules that are **reused together** should be grouped into the same component.
- **Goal**: Avoid forcing users of a component to depend on classes they don’t need.
- **Example**:
  - A `database` component should include classes related to database operations (e.g., `DatabaseConnection`, `QueryExecutor`, `ResultSetParser`).

---

## **Component Coupling Principles**

### **4. The Acyclic Dependencies Principle**
- **Definition**: The dependency graph of components should have **no cycles**.
- **Goal**: Avoid circular dependencies, which can lead to build and maintenance issues.
- **Example**:
  - If `ComponentA` depends on `ComponentB`, `ComponentB` should not depend on `ComponentA`.

---

### **5. The Stable Dependencies Principle**
- **Definition**: Components should depend on components that are **more stable** than themselves.
- **Goal**: Ensure that changes in less stable components do not affect more stable ones.
- **Example**:
  - A `core` utility component should be stable and not depend on a frequently changing `feature` component.

---

### **6. The Stable Abstraction Principle**
- **Definition**: Stable components should be **abstract** (e.g., interfaces or abstract classes), while less stable components should be **concrete**.
- **Goal**: Ensure stability and flexibility in the system.
- **Example**:
  - A `PaymentGateway` interface should be stable, while its implementations (e.g., `PayPalGateway`, `StripeGateway`) can change frequently.

---

## **General Design Principles**

### **7. DRY (Do Not Repeat Yourself)

---

### **8. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

---

### **9. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**

---

### **10. Law of Demeter – Friend of a Friend**
- **Definition**: A class should only interact with its **immediate dependencies**, not with the dependencies of its dependencies.
- **Goal**: Reduce coupling and improve modularity.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of `car.getEngine().getStarter().start()`, use `car.startEngine()`.

---

### **11. Composition Over Inheritance**
- **Definition**: Favor **composition** (building objects by combining other objects) over **inheritance** (extending classes).
- **Goal**: Avoid the rigidity and complexity of deep inheritance hierarchies.
- **Example**:
  - Instead of inheriting from a `Vehicle` class, compose a `Car` class with an `Engine` object.

---

### **12. Fail-Fast**
- **Definition**: Detect and report errors as early as possible.
- **Goal**: Prevent issues from propagating and becoming harder to debug.
- **Example**:
  - Validate inputs at the start of a method and throw exceptions immediately if something is wrong.
