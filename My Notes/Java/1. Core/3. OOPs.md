### 1. **What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that revolves around **objects**—instances of classes that encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods). It allows you to design programs that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.

---

### 2. **Key Principles of OOP**

OOP is based on four main principles:

1. **Encapsulation**:
    
    - Wrapping data (variables) and methods (functions) inside a class.
    - **Example**: Protecting class variables by declaring them private and providing public getter/setter methods.
2. **Inheritance**:
    
    - Mechanism where one class (child) acquires properties and behaviors from another class (parent).
    - **Example**: A `Car` class can inherit properties from a `Vehicle` class.
3. **Polymorphism**:
    
    - Ability of an object to take on multiple forms.
    - **Example**: A method `drive()` behaves differently for a `Car` object and a `Bike` object.
4. **Abstraction**:
    
    - Hiding implementation details and showing only essential features.
    - **Example**: Using interfaces to define behaviors without specifying how they work.

### **Class**:

A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines a data structure that holds state (variables) and behavior (methods). A class specifies what properties and actions an object of that type will have, but it does not create any actual objects by itself.

**Example**: A `Car` class defines properties like `color`, `model`, and `year`, and methods like `start()` and `stop()`.

### **Object**:

An **object** is an instance of a class. It is created based on the blueprint provided by the class. When an object is created, it holds actual values for the properties and can execute the behaviors (methods) defined by the class.

**Example**: An actual car object like `myCar` can have `color = "Red"`, `model = "Tesla"`, and `year = 2020`, and it can perform actions like `start()` and `stop()`.

In summary:

- A **class** defines properties and methods.
- An **object** is an actual instance of that class with specific values.

### 3. **Object-Oriented vs. Object-Based Programming Languages**

| **Object-Oriented**                                                                  | **Object-Based**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supports all OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction). | Supports Encapsulation but not Inheritance or Polymorphism. |
| Example: Java, C++, Python                                                           | Example: JavaScript (prior to ES6)                          |

### 4. **Default Value of Object Reference in an Instance Variable**

- If an object reference is declared as an instance variable but not initialized, its default value is `null`.

---

### 5. **Constructors in Java**

#### What is a Constructor?

- A **constructor** is a special method used to initialize an object when it is created.
- It has the same name as the class and no return type.

#### Why Do We Need a Constructor?

- To initialize an object with default or specific values.  
    **Example**:
    
    ```java
    class Person {
        String name;
        int age;
    
        // Constructor
        Person(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }
    ```
    

#### What is a Default Constructor?

- A default constructor is a no-argument constructor provided by Java if no other constructors are defined.
- **Why Do We Need It?**: If no constructors exist, the default constructor ensures that objects can still be created.

---

### 6. **Value Returned by a Constructor**

- A constructor **does not return any value**, not even `void`. Instead, it initializes the object and returns the new instance of the object implicitly.

---

### 7. **Can We Inherit a Constructor?**

- **No**, constructors are not inherited in Java. However, a subclass can call a parent class constructor using the `super()` keyword.

---

### 8. **Why Can’t Constructors Be `final`, `static`, or `abstract`?**

#### **Final Constructor**:

- The `final` keyword in Java is used to **prevent method overriding** or **class inheritance**.
- However, **constructors** are specifically designed to **initialize objects** when instances are created.
- Since constructors **cannot be overridden** (you cannot extend a class and change the constructor), the `final` keyword is **not applicable** to constructors.
- Attempting to declare a constructor as `final` will result in a **compilation error**.

#### **Static Constructor**:

- A `static` method belongs to the class, not to an instance. A constructor is inherently tied to an object, so making it `static` is contradictory.
- Trying to declare a constructor as static will result in a **compilation error**.

#### **Abstract Constructor**:

- An `abstract` method is incomplete and must be overridden. A constructor is complete and initializes objects, so making it `abstract` is illogical.

#### **Final Constructor**:

- **Constructors cannot be `final`** because they are not meant to be overridden or inherited.

# Questions

* How to make a class immutable?
	* 1. **Declare the class as `final`:** This ensures the class cannot be extended.
	2. **Make all fields `private` and `final`:** Prevents direct access and ensures the values are set only once.
	3. **Do not provide setters:** This avoids modifying the fields after the object is created.
	4. **Initialize all fields through the constructor:** Set the values of all fields when the object is created.
	5. **Perform deep copies for mutable objects:** If the class contains fields that reference mutable objects, return a deep copy instead of the original object.
---
### **Why Constructors Cannot Be Overridden:**

1. **Constructors are not inherited**:
    
    - Constructors are not inherited by subclasses like regular methods. Each class has its own constructor that is used to initialize objects of that class.
    - Although a subclass can **call** a parent class constructor using the `super()` keyword, this is not the same as **overriding** the constructor.
2. **Constructor is tied to object creation**:
    
    - A constructor is a special method used specifically for **creating objects**. It is tied to the class itself and not to instances in the same way regular methods are.
    - **Overriding** occurs when a subclass provides a new implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. Since constructors are not inherited, they cannot be overridden.
