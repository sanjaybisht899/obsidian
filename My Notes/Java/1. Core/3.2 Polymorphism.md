### **1. What is Polymorphism in Java?**

Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of a single action to behave differently based on the context. The word "polymorphism" comes from Greek, meaning **"many forms"**.

#### Types of Polymorphism:

1. **Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: The behavior is determined at compile time.
2. **Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: The behavior is determined at runtime.

---

### **2. Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**

#### **What is Method Overloading?**

Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the **same name** but different parameters (number, type, or order of parameters).

#### Other Name of Method Overloading:

It is also known as **Static Polymorphism** or **Early Binding**.

#### **How to Implement Method Overloading?**

You can create multiple methods with the same name but vary:

- **Number of arguments**
- **Type of arguments**
- **Order of arguments**

#### Example:

```java
class Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b; // Two integer parameters
    }
    
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b; // Two double parameters
    }
    
    int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c; // Three integer parameters
    }
}
```

#### Why Canâ€™t Method Overloading Be Done by Changing the Return Type?

- The compiler determines which method to call based on parameters, not return type.
- Ambiguity occurs if only the return type is different.

#### Can You Overload the `main()` Method?

Yes, you can overload the `main()` method. However, the JVM always calls the standard version:

```java
public static void main(String[] args).
```

#### Example:

```java
public class MainOverloading {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Main with String[] args");
    }
    
    public static void main(String arg) {
        System.out.println("Main with String arg");
    }
}
```

### **3. Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**

#### **What is Method Overriding?**

Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.

#### How to Implement Method Overriding?

1. The method in the child class must have the **same name, parameters, and return type** as the method in the parent class.
2. The method in the parent class must be **non-static** and **not final**.

#### Example:

```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}
```

#### Is It Possible to Override a Static Method?

No, you cannot override a static method. Static methods are bound to the class, not the instance.

#### Why Can't Static Methods Be Overridden?

- Static methods are resolved using **static binding** during compile time.
- Overriding is a **runtime** concept, and static methods are not tied to runtime behavior.

---

### **4. Difference Between Method Overloading and Method Overriding**

|**Aspect**|**Method Overloading**|**Method Overriding**|
|---|---|---|
|**Binding**|Compile-time (static binding).|Runtime (dynamic binding).|
|**Parameters**|Requires a different number or type of parameters.|Must have the same parameters as the parent method.|
|**Inheritance**|Not required.|Requires inheritance.|
|**Return Type**|Can have different return types.|Must have the same return type or a covariant return type.|
|**Static Methods**|Static methods can be overloaded.|Static methods cannot be overridden.|

---

### **5. Covariant Return Type**

In Java, the return type of the overriding method in the child class can be a **subtype** of the return type of the method in the parent class.

#### Example:

```java
class Parent {
    Parent getObject() {
        return this;
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    Child getObject() {
        return this; // Covariant return type
    }
}
```

---

### **6. Binding in Java**

#### **Static Binding (Compile-Time Polymorphism)**:

- Methods are bound to their definitions during compile time.
- Applies to **method overloading** and static methods.

#### **Dynamic Binding (Runtime Polymorphism)**:

- Methods are resolved at runtime based on the object's actual type.
- Applies to **method overriding**.

#### Example of Binding:

```java
class A {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class B extends A {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        A obj = new B(); // Parent reference, child object
        obj.show(); // Dynamic binding, calls Child's show()
    }
}
```

### **7. Virtual Functions in Java**

In Java, all non-static methods are **virtual functions** by default, meaning they can be overridden in child classes.

---

### **9. Object Cloning**

Object cloning allows you to create a copy of an object using the `clone()` method.

- To use cloning, a class must implement the **`Cloneable`** interface.

#### Example:

```java
class Example implements Cloneable {
    int data = 10;

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone();
    }
}
```
