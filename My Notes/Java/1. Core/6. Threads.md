#### **What is a Thread in Java?**

A **Thread** in Java is a lightweight process that allows concurrent execution of tasks. It runs within the context of a process and shares the process's resources.

There are **two common ways** to create a thread in Java:

1. **By Extending the `Thread` class**.
2. **By Implementing the `Runnable` interface**.
---
### **1. Extending the `Thread` Class**

- Subclass the `Thread` class and override its `run()` method.
- Start the thread using the `start()` method.

**Example**:

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running by extending Thread class.");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start(); // Starts a new thread
    }
}
```

---

### **2. Implementing the `Runnable` Interface**

- Implement the `Runnable` interface and define the `run()` method.
- Pass the `Runnable` object to a `Thread` instance and call `start()`.

**Example**:

```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running by implementing Runnable.");
    }
}

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
        t.start(); // Starts a new thread
    }
}
```
### **Difference Between `Thread` vs. `Runnable`**

|**Aspect**|**Extending `Thread`**|**Implementing `Runnable`**|
|---|---|---|
|**Inheritance**|Requires subclassing the `Thread` class, so you cannot extend other classes.|Allows extending other classes, promoting better design.|
|**Reusability**|Thread class logic is tightly coupled to the thread.|Runnable provides better separation of thread logic.|
|**Object Sharing**|Not ideal for sharing a thread’s logic across objects.|Multiple threads can share the same `Runnable` object.|
|**Code Design**|Less flexible; tightly binds thread behavior to the class.|Promotes cleaner and modular code.|

### **Recommendation**

Prefer **`Runnable`** for better design, flexibility, and reusability.

#### **What is the Priority of a Thread and How is it Used in Scheduling?**

Thread priority determines the order in which threads are scheduled for execution by the JVM. Higher priority threads are given preference, but thread scheduling ultimately depends on the underlying OS.

- Priorities range from **1 (MIN_PRIORITY)** to **10 (MAX_PRIORITY)**.

---

#### **What is the Default Priority of a Thread in Java?**

The default priority of a thread is **5 (NORM_PRIORITY)**.

```java
public class ThreadPriorityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Thread running"));
        System.out.println("Default Priority: " + thread.getPriority());
    }
}
```

---

#### **Three Different Priorities for Threads in Java**

1. **MIN_PRIORITY**: Value is 1.
2. **NORM_PRIORITY**: Value is 5 (default).
3. **MAX_PRIORITY**: Value is 10.

---

#### **What is the Purpose of the `join()` Method in the Thread Class?**

The `join()` method in Java is used to make one thread wait until another thread completes its execution. It ensures that a thread does not proceed until the specified thread finishes.

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Child thread is running...");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread thread = new MyThread();
        thread.start();
        thread.join(); // Main thread waits for MyThread to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread resumes after child thread");
    }
}
```

---

#### **Difference Between `wait()` and `sleep()`**

- **`wait()`**: Releases the lock and pauses the thread until another thread notifies it.
- **`sleep()`**: Puts the thread to sleep for a specified duration but does not release the lock.

```java
class WaitAndSleepExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Object lock = new Object();
        synchronized (lock) {
            lock.wait(); // Waits for a notification
        }
        
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Sleeps for 1 second
    }
}
```

---

#### **Is it Possible to Call `run()` Instead of `start()` on a Thread?**

Yes, but calling `run()` directly does not start a new thread. It simply executes the code in the current thread.

| **Aspect**               | **`start()`**                                           | **`run()`**                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Starts a new thread and executes `run()` in it.         | Executes `run()` in the current thread.               |
| **Creates a New Thread** | Yes                                                     | No                                                    |
| **Concurrency**          | Code in `run()` runs concurrently with the main thread. | Code in `run()` runs sequentially in the main thread. |
| **System Resources**     | Allocates system resources for a new thread.            | No additional resources allocated.                    |

---

#### **What is a Daemon Thread in Java?**

A daemon thread runs in the background to perform tasks like garbage collection. It terminates automatically when all non-daemon threads finish execution.

---

#### **How to Make a Regular Thread a Daemon Thread?**

Use the `setDaemon(true)` method before starting the thread.

```java
public class DaemonExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread daemonThread = new Thread(() -> System.out.println("Daemon thread running"));
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
        daemonThread.start();
    }
}
```

---

#### **What is Concurrency and How to Achieve It?**

Concurrency refers to the ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously. It can be achieved using:

- **Threads**
- **Executor Framework**
- **Fork/Join Framework**
- **CompletableFuture**

---

### **Key Multithreading Concepts**

#### **Executors (Thread Pooling)**

The **Executor Framework** in Java is a high-level API for managing and controlling thread execution. It helps in efficiently handling multiple threads without manually creating and managing them.

It is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package and provides various thread pool implementations to improve performance and resource management.

---

### **How is the Executor Framework Used?**

1. **Create an Executor Service:**  
    You can create different types of thread pools using the `Executors` class.
    
    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3); // Pool with 3 threads
    ```
    
2. **Submit Tasks:**  
    Submit tasks using `submit()` or `execute()` methods.
    
    ```java
    executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task is running"));
    ```
    
3. **Shutdown the Executor:**  
    After execution, always shut down the executor to free resources.
    
    ```java
    executor.shutdown();
    ```
    

---

### **Example Usage:**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);

        Runnable task1 = () -> System.out.println("Task 1 is running");
        Runnable task2 = () -> System.out.println("Task 2 is running");

        executor.submit(task1);
        executor.submit(task2);

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

**Output (order may vary due to multithreading):**

```
Task 1 is running
Task 2 is running
```

---

### **Why Use Executor Framework?**

- **Manages thread lifecycle** (creation, execution, termination).
- **Prevents excessive thread creation**, improving performance.
- **Provides different thread pools** (`FixedThreadPool`, `CachedThreadPool`, `ScheduledThreadPool`).
- **Supports parallel processing** with controlled concurrency.

---

#### **Synchronization**

Ensures that only one thread accesses a critical section at a time.

```java
class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public synchronized void increment() {
        count++;
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

---

#### **Locks and Conditions**

Java provides the `Lock` interface and `Condition` for advanced thread synchronization.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LockExample {
    private final Lock lock = new RentrantLock();

    public void criticalSection() {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            System.out.println("Critical section");
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

---

#### **Concurrent Collections**

Thread-safe collection classes like `ConcurrentHashMap` and `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.

---

#### **Atomic Variables**

Used for atomic operations on single variables.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class AtomicExample {
    private final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

    public void increment() {
        count.incrementAndGet();
    }

    public int getCount() {
        return count.get();
    }
}
```


### **Why Was `Atomic` Required? What Was the Issue With `volatile`?**

- The `volatile` keyword ensures **visibility** (all threads always see the latest value of a variable). However, it does **not ensure atomicity**, meaning operations like `count++` are **not thread-safe** when accessed by multiple threads.

#### **Example Problem with `volatile` (Not Atomic)**

Imagine two people updating a shared notebook:

1. **Person A reads** the value "5".
2. **Person B reads** the same value "5".
3. **Person A adds 1** and writes "6".
4. **Person B adds 1** to their (old) value "5" and writes "6" again.

Final value **should be 7** but ends up as **6** due to lost updates.

#### **Solution: Using `Atomic`**

- **Atomic variables** (like `AtomicInteger`) ensure that the entire read-modify-write operation happens **as a single unit**.
- In the same scenario, if both people used an atomic counter, one update would **complete before** the next starts, ensuring correctness.


---

#### **Fork/Join Framework**

Used for parallel processing by breaking tasks into subtasks.

---

#### **CompletableFuture**


`CompletableFuture` is used for **asynchronous, non-blocking** programming in Java. It runs tasks in the background and handles results when ready.

### **Example: Fetching Data Asynchronously**

Instead of blocking:

```java
User user = fetchUser();  // Blocks main thread
processUser(user);
```

Use `CompletableFuture`:

```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> fetchUser())  
                 .thenApply(user -> processUser(user))
                 .thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Done!"));
```

✅ Runs in the **background**, improving performance.

### **Key Features**

- `supplyAsync()` → Runs a task asynchronously.
- `thenApply()` → Transforms the result.
- `thenAccept()` → Consumes result when ready.
- `thenCombine()` → Merges results from multiple tasks.

**Use Case**: Parallel API calls, background tasks, performance optimization. 🚀

---

### **Benefits of Multithreading**

4. Improved performance and responsiveness.
5. Efficient use of system resources.
6. Parallelism for computational tasks.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Use thread pools instead of creating new threads.
- Minimize synchronization to avoid contention.
- Use concurrent collections for thread safety.

---

#### **Thread Pools in Java**

Thread pools manage a group of reusable threads to execute tasks efficiently.

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task running"));
executor.shutdown();
```

### **Benefits of Thread Pools in Java**

1. **Improves Performance & Throughput**
    
    - Reuses existing threads instead of creating new ones, reducing the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
2. **Prevents Resource Exhaustion**
    
    - Limits the number of active threads to avoid excessive CPU and memory consumption, preventing **OutOfMemoryErrors**.
3. **Efficient Task Management**
    
    - Threads are assigned tasks from a queue, ensuring **optimal CPU utilization** and preventing system overload.
4. **Avoids Thread Starvation & Deadlocks**
    
    - Ensures that critical tasks always have access to execution resources, preventing a single task from blocking the entire system.
5. **Better Responsiveness**
    
    - Tasks execute faster since threads are pre-created and available, reducing response times.
6. **Isolation of Workloads**
    
    - Different pools can be used for different operations (e.g., one for database queries, another for API calls), preventing one workload from affecting another.
7. **Supports Scalability**
    
    - Thread pools adjust dynamically to workload changes, maintaining system stability under high traffic.

# Question

7. What is volatile keyword?
	- The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a variable's value will be modified by multiple threads.
	- It ensures that changes made to the variable in one thread are immediately visible to other threads.
	- #### **Characteristics**:
		1. **Prevents Caching**:
		    - A `volatile` variable is not cached locally by threads.
		    - Every read and write operation happens directly in the main memory.
		2. **Visibility Guarantee**:
		    - When a thread updates a `volatile` variable, all other threads see the updated value.
		3. **Does Not Ensure Atomicity**:
		    - Operations on a `volatile` variable are not atomic (e.g., `counter++` is not thread-safe).
		4. **Applicable Only to Variables**:
		    - Cannot be used with methods, classes, or blocks.
- 2. What is transient keyword?
	-  The `transient` keyword is used to indicate that a variable should not be serialized.
	- During serialization, transient variables are **not included** in the serialized state of an object.
	- #### **Characteristics**:
		1. **Serialization**:
		    
		    - Used with `Serializable` objects.
		    - When an object is serialized, transient variables are skipped.
		2. **Default Value After Deserialization**:
		    
		    - Transient variables are initialized to their default values (`null` for objects, `0` for integers, `false` for booleans, etc.).
		3. **Applicable Only to Instance Variables**:
		    
		    - Cannot be applied to methods, classes, or static variables.

##### How can you create a Java program using two threads, where one thread prints odd numbers and the other prints even numbers, ensuring they run simultaneously and produce a sequential output like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ...?

### **Approach**

- We use a **shared object (lock)** to synchronize the threads.
- The **odd thread** prints odd numbers.
- The **even thread** prints even numbers.
- **Synchronization (`wait()` & `notify()`)** ensures correct order.

### **Code Implementation**

```java
class PrintNumbers {
    private int num = 1;
    private final int MAX = 10; // Limit to print

    public synchronized void printOdd() {
        while (num < MAX) {
            while (num % 2 == 0) { // If even, wait
                try {
                    wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + num);
            num++;
            notify(); // Notify the even thread
        }
    }

    public synchronized void printEven() {
        while (num <= MAX) {
            while (num % 2 != 0) { // If odd, wait
                try {
                    wait();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + num);
            num++;
            notify(); // Notify the odd thread
        }
    }
}

public class OddEvenThread {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrintNumbers obj = new PrintNumbers();

        Thread oddThread = new Thread(() -> obj.printOdd(), "Odd Thread");
        Thread evenThread = new Thread(() -> obj.printEven(), "Even Thread");

        oddThread.start();
        evenThread.start();
    }
}
```

### **🔹 Difference Between `synchronized` Method vs. `synchronized` Block**

|Feature|**Synchronized Method**|**Synchronized Block (using `synchronized` keyword)**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope of Lock**|Locks the **entire method**|Locks **only a specific block of code**|
|**Performance**|**Slower**, as it locks the whole method|**Faster**, as it locks only the critical section|
|**Flexibility**|**Less flexible** (locks everything inside method)|**More flexible** (can lock a specific object)|
|**Locking Object**|Locks **the current object (`this`)** by default|Can lock **any object**, including `this`, a custom object, or `ClassName.class`|
|**Example Usage**|When **entire method needs thread-safety**|When **only part of a method needs synchronization**|

---

### **✅ Example of `synchronized` Method**

```java
class SharedResource {
    public synchronized void show() {  // Locks entire method
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is executing");
        try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
}
```

📌 **Locks the whole method**, meaning only one thread can execute `show()` at a time.

---

### **✅ Example of `synchronized` Block**

```java
class SharedResource {
    public void show() {
        synchronized (this) {  // Locks only this block
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is executing");
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}
```

📌 **Locks only the block inside `synchronized (this)`, allowing better performance**.

---

### **🔹 When to Use What?**

|**Use Case**|**Which to Use?**|
|---|---|
|If **entire method** must be synchronized|Use **`synchronized` method**|
|If **only a part** of the method needs synchronization|Use **`synchronized` block**|
|If you need **fine-grained locking** on a specific object|Use **`synchronized(object)`**|

---

### **Preventing Re-Assignment in a Multithreaded Environment**

To ensure a variable **is assigned only once** and cannot be reassigned by multiple threads, you can use different techniques:
### **1️⃣ Use `AtomicReference` (Best for One-Time Assignment)**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicReference;

public class SingletonExample {
    private static final AtomicReference<String> value = new AtomicReference<>(null);

    public static void setValue(String newValue) {
        value.compareAndSet(null, newValue); // Sets only if it's null
    }

    public static String getValue() {
        return value.get();
    }
}
```

✅ Ensures the value is **set only once**, even in a multithreaded environment.

### **2️⃣ Use `synchronized` for Controlled Assignment**

```java
public class SharedResource {
    private static String data;

    public static synchronized void setData(String newData) {
        if (data == null) {  // Ensures assignment only happens once
            data = newData;
        }
    }

    public static String getData() {
        return data;
    }
}
```

✅ Only one thread can assign the value at a time.

### **3️⃣ Use `volatile` with Double-Checked Locking**

```java
public class Config {
    private static volatile String value;

    public static void setValue(String newValue) {
        if (value == null) {  // First check (without lock)
            synchronized (Config.class) {
                if (value == null) {  // Second check (with lock)
                    value = newValue;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static String getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

✅ Prevents unnecessary synchronization **after initialization**.

### **📌 Which One to Use?**

- **For simple one-time assignment:** `AtomicReference`
- **For thread-safe controlled assignment:** `synchronized`
- **For performance optimization:** `volatile` + **double-checked locking`

---

### **Difference between `synchronized (Config.class)` and `synchronized (this)`**

|Feature|`synchronized(Config.class)`|`synchronized(this)`|
|---|---|---|
|**Lock Type**|Class-level lock (applies to all instances).|Object-level lock (applies to a single instance).|
|**Scope**|Synchronizes access to **static members**.|Synchronizes access to **instance members**.|
|**Use Case**|Used when working with **static variables/methods**.|Used when working with **instance variables/methods**.|
|**Concurrency Impact**|Prevents all threads from entering any synchronized block on this class.|Only blocks threads trying to access the same instance.|
|**Example Usage**|`synchronized (Config.class) { ... }`|`synchronized (this) { ... }`|
|**Common Scenario**|Singleton patterns, static data modification.|Protecting instance-specific operations.|

---

### **When to Use Which?**

✅ Use **`synchronized(Config.class)`** when synchronizing **static members** (shared across all instances).  
✅ Use **`synchronized(this)`** when synchronizing **instance-specific operations**.

---
### **Deadlock in Java**

A **deadlock** occurs in Java when **two or more threads** are waiting for each other to release resources, but **none can proceed**, causing an infinite wait.

### **Example: Deadlock in Java**

```java
class Resource {
    String name;
    
    public Resource(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class DeadlockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Resource resource1 = new Resource("Resource 1");
        Resource resource2 = new Resource("Resource 2");

        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource1) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked " + resource1.name);
                
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}

                synchronized (resource2) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked " + resource2.name);
                }
            }
        });

        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            synchronized (resource2) {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked " + resource2.name);
                
                try { Thread.sleep(100); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}

                synchronized (resource1) {
                    System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " locked " + resource1.name);
                }
            }
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### **How Deadlock Happens:**

1. **Thread 1** locks `resource1` and waits for `resource2`.
2. **Thread 2** locks `resource2` and waits for `resource1`.
3. Both threads **wait forever**, causing a deadlock.

### **How to Fix Deadlock?**

✅ **Acquire Locks in a Consistent Order** – Always lock **A first, then B** in all threads.  
✅ **Use `tryLock()` Instead of `synchronized`** – Avoid waiting indefinitely if a lock isn't available.  
✅ **Use Timeout with Locks** – Set a timeout to prevent threads from waiting forever.  
✅ **Minimize Locking Scope** – Lock only when necessary and release ASAP.  
✅ **Detect Deadlocks with Monitoring Tools** – Use `jstack` or Thread Dump analysis.

---

### **🔹 What is `ThreadLocal`?**

`ThreadLocal<T>` is a special Java class that provides **thread-local variables**.

- Each thread accessing a `ThreadLocal` variable gets **its own, isolated copy**.
- Changes made by one thread **do not** affect other threads.

---

### **🔹 Why Use `ThreadLocal`?**

✅ Avoids race conditions in multithreading.  
✅ Provides **thread-specific** state without using **synchronization (`synchronized`)**.  
✅ Useful in scenarios like **storing user sessions, database connections, and transactions**.

---

### **🔹 How to Use `ThreadLocal`?**

Here’s an example:

```java
class ThreadLocalExample {
    // Creating a ThreadLocal variable
    private static final ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocalVar = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> 0);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            int value = threadLocalVar.get(); // Get current thread's value
            threadLocalVar.set(value + 1); // Modify it
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " → " + threadLocalVar.get());
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "Thread-1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "Thread-2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

### **🔹 Output (Values remain isolated per thread)**

```
Thread-1 → 1
Thread-2 → 1
```

Each thread gets its **own separate copy** of the variable. Changes made by one thread **do not affect** others.

### **🔹 Key Methods of `ThreadLocal<T>`**

|Method|Description|
|---|---|
|`get()`|Retrieves the value for the current thread.|
|`set(T value)`|Sets the value for the current thread.|
|`remove()`|Removes the value, preventing memory leaks.|
|`withInitial(Supplier<T>)`|Initializes the `ThreadLocal` variable.|

---

### **🔹 Common Use Cases**

1️⃣ **User Sessions in Web Apps**

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<String> userSession = new ThreadLocal<>();
```

2️⃣ **Database Connections (Avoids sharing connection across threads)**

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<Connection> dbConnection = new ThreadLocal<>();
```

3️⃣ **Logging with Unique Request IDs**

```java
private static final ThreadLocal<String> requestId = ThreadLocal.withInitial(() -> UUID.randomUUID().toString());
```

---

### **🔹 `ThreadLocal` Best Practices & Pitfalls**

🚀 **Always call `remove()` in `finally` block** to avoid **memory leaks**.

```java
try {
    threadLocalVar.set("Some Value");
} finally {
    threadLocalVar.remove();
}
```

🚀 **Do not use in thread pools**, because threads **may reuse old values**.  
🚀 **Use `InheritableThreadLocal`** if child threads need to inherit values.

### **🔹 Alternative to `ThreadLocal`?**

- **Spring's `@RequestScope`** for web apps.
- **`CompletableFuture` context passing** for async tasks.
- **`java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`** for managing per-thread data.

---

### **🔹 Key Takeaways**

✅ `ThreadLocal` allows **each thread to have its own copy** of a variable.  
✅ Eliminates the need for **synchronization** in multi-threaded programs.  
✅ **Always call `remove()` to prevent memory leaks.**

## Can you change the return type of  the run() method?

- **No**, you cannot change the return type of the `run()` method when overriding it in a `Thread` subclass.
- The `run()` method in the `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface is defined as:
  ```java
  public void run()
  ```
- Overriding requires the **same method signature**, so the return type must remain `void`.

---
### **What If You Need to Return a Value?**
1. Use **`Callable`** instead of `Runnable`:
   - `Callable` allows returning a value and throwing exceptions.
   - Example:
     ```java
     Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
         System.out.println("Child thread is running...");
         return 42; // Return a value
     };
     ```

2. Use a **shared variable** to store the result:
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyThread extends Thread {
         private int result;
         public void run() {
             result = 42; // Store the result
         }
         public int getResult() { return result; }
     }
     ```
### **Key Takeaways**
- `run()` must have a `void` return type.
- Use `Callable` or a shared variable to return values from threads.
