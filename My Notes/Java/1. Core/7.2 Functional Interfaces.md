#### **What is a Functional Interface in Java 8?**

A Functional Interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method, also known as a Single Abstract Method (SAM). It is designed for Lambda Expressions and method references.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    int apply(int a, int b);
}
```

#### **What is a Single Abstract Method (SAM) interface in Java 8?**

A SAM Interface is an interface with exactly one abstract method. The concept allows a Lambda Expression to match the method signature of the abstract method.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyRunnable {
    void run();
}
```

#### **How can we define a Functional Interface in Java 8?**

To define a Functional Interface:

1. Use the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation (optional but recommended).
2. Ensure it contains only one abstract method.
3. Add `default` or `static` methods if required.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Calculator {
    int calculate(int a, int b);
}
```

#### **Why do we need Functional Interfaces in Java?**

1. **Support for Lambda Expressions**:
    - Functional Interfaces provide the target type for Lambdas.
2. **Simplifies Code**:
    - Enables concise and clear code.
3. **Reusable Abstractions**:
    - Encourages creating reusable functional abstractions.
4. **Stream API Support**:
    - Many Stream operations are built around functional interfaces like `Function`, `Consumer`, and `Predicate`.

#### **Is it mandatory to use `@FunctionalInterface` annotation to define a Functional Interface in Java 8?**

No, it is not mandatory. However, it is highly recommended to:

1. Enforce that the interface has exactly one abstract method.
2. Prevent accidental addition of more abstract methods in the future.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}
```

Without the annotation:

```java
interface Printer {
    void print(String message);
}
```

Both are valid but using `@FunctionalInterface` provides compile-time safety.
