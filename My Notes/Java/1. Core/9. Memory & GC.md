### **Java Memory Model**

The Java Memory Model (JMM) describes how Java programs interact with memory, defining how variables are stored and how threads access shared memory.

### **Places Where Data is Stored in Java**

1. **Heap**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Stores objects and class instances.
    - **Characteristics**: All objects, arrays, and class instances are created in the heap.
    - **Key Point**: The heap is shared by all threads.
2. **Stack**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Stores method calls, local variables, and method parameters.
    - **Characteristics**: Memory is allocated and deallocated automatically for each method call.
    - **Key Point**: Stack frames store method calls and local variables. Data in the stack is accessed and modified by threads.
3. **Method Area**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Stores class-level data (like method and static variables).
    - **Characteristics**: Shared across threads, contains runtime constant pool, loaded classes, and metadata.
    - **Method Area** (part of **Metaspace** in Java 8+): Stores:
		- Class metadata (structure of the class)
		- Static variables
		- Method bytecode
		- Constant pool (String pool, literals)
    - **Key Point**: Methods, constants, class-level variables are stored here.
4. **PC Register (Program Counter)**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Holds the address of the current instruction being executed in a thread.
    - **Characteristics**: It’s a small, thread-private memory space.
    - **Key Point**: Used to track where the CPU should continue execution from within a thread.
5. **Native Method Stack**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Stores memory for native (non-Java) method calls.
    - **Characteristics**: Used when calling native methods (like JNI).
    - **Key Point**: Allocated and deallocated per native method call.
6. **String Constant Pool**:
    
    - **Purpose**: Stores string literals and prevents duplicate string objects.
    - **Characteristics**: Optimized to store strings in a shared way, avoiding memory waste.
    - **Key Point**: It’s part of the heap and helps reduce memory usage.

### **Java Garbage Collection**

Garbage collection in Java automatically manages memory, cleaning up objects that are no longer in use to free up memory space. Here’s how it works:

#### **Steps in Garbage Collection**

1. **Mark Phase**:
    
    - The garbage collector identifies objects that are unreachable or no longer in use.
2. **Sweep Phase**:
    
    - The garbage collector clears the marked objects from memory, making that memory available for reuse.
3. **Compact Phase** (optional):
    
    - After cleaning, if needed, the garbage collector will compact the heap to reclaim fragmented memory, making continuous blocks available for new object allocation.

#### **Key Concepts in Garbage Collection**:

- **Reference Types**:
    
    - **Strong Reference**: Default behavior; objects are not collected until there are no references to them.
    - **Soft Reference**: Objects are garbage-collected only if JVM runs out of memory.
    - **Weak Reference**: Objects can be garbage-collected as soon as there are no strong references.
    - **Phantom Reference**: Objects are subject to collection once they are completely unreachable.
- **Garbage Collection Types**:
    
    - **Minor GC**: Garbage collection within the heap, primarily of young objects.
    - **Major GC** (Full GC): Involves collecting older objects and cleaning up the heap.
    - **Concurrent GC**: Performs garbage collection without stopping the application.
    - **G1 GC** (Garbage First): Optimizes pause times and provides better predictability for collection times.
- **Garbage Collection Tuning**:
    
    - JVM offers options to tune garbage collection through parameters like `-Xms`, `-Xmx`, `-XX:+UseG1GC`, `-XX:+UseParallelGC`, etc., to control memory allocation and garbage collection behavior.


### **Stack and Heap in Java Multi-Threading Environment**

In Java, **stack** and **heap** play critical roles in managing memory, and their behavior can change in a multi-threading environment:

#### **Stack**:

- **Thread-Private**:  
    Each thread has its own stack, meaning that each thread’s stack is independent of other threads. This stack stores method calls, local variables, and method parameters.
    
- **LIFO (Last-In-First-Out)**:  
    When a thread invokes a method, memory for local variables and method parameters is pushed onto the stack. Once the method completes, this memory is popped from the stack.
    
- **Thread-Safe**:  
    Access to the stack is thread-safe, and stack memory is automatically cleared once the method execution completes, so there’s no need for manual management in multi-threading.
    

#### **Heap**:

- **Shared by All Threads**:  
    The heap is shared across all threads in a Java application. It’s used to store objects and class instances.
    
- **Garbage Collection**:  
    Garbage collection manages memory in the heap, cleaning up objects that are no longer used. In multi-threading, multiple threads can simultaneously create, access, and modify objects in the heap, but thread safety must be handled to avoid race conditions.
    
- **Synchronization**:  
    In a multi-threading environment, synchronization is important when accessing shared data in the heap to avoid data inconsistency. Java uses mechanisms like `synchronized`, `Locks`, `volatile`, and `ReentrantLock` to control access to heap data and ensure thread safety.

### **How Stack and Heap Interact in Multi-Threading**:

- **Stack**:
    
    - Each thread has its own separate stack.
    - Stack stores local variables, method parameters, and function call sequences.
    - It doesn’t share data with other threads, making stack operations safe within individual threads.
- **Heap**:
    
    - The heap is shared among all threads, which means it holds objects and instances that can be accessed and modified by multiple threads.
    - Careful synchronization (e.g., using `synchronized`, `Lock`, `volatile`, etc.) is required when working with shared objects in the heap to prevent race conditions and ensure thread safety.

### **Multi-Threading Challenges**:

- **Race Conditions**:  
    Multiple threads can access and modify shared objects in the heap, leading to race conditions. Synchronization techniques (locks, `synchronized` methods, `volatile` variables) help to manage access and avoid conflicts.
    
- **Memory Visibility**:  
    In multi-threading, changes made to the heap by one thread may not be visible to other threads immediately unless proper synchronization is used.
    


# Questions

1. Is after every function end GC get called?
	1. No, the **Garbage Collector (GC)** in Java does **not** get called automatically after every function ends. The garbage collection process is managed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and operates independently of the normal flow of program execution. Here's a detailed explanation:
	2. 1. **Automatic, but Not Immediate**:
    
    - Java's garbage collector runs automatically, but the timing is controlled by the JVM, not by your code.
    - It **does not run immediately** after a function ends or when an object becomes unreachable.
2. **When Does GC Run?**:
    
    - The JVM decides when to run garbage collection based on memory demand.
    - It usually runs when:
        - The heap memory is low.
        - There are too many unreachable objects to clean up.
3. **Objects Become Eligible for GC**:
    
    - An object is eligible for garbage collection if it is no longer reachable from any active thread or static reference.
    - This can happen when:
        - A method ends, and its local variables go out of scope.
        - You explicitly set a reference to `null`.
4. **Manual GC Triggering**:
    
    - You can manually **suggest** garbage collection by calling `System.gc()` or `Runtime.getRuntime().gc()`, but:
        - This is only a **request** to the JVM. The JVM may or may not honor it immediately.
        - Frequent manual requests for garbage collection can negatively affect performance.

### **Why Doesn’t GC Run After Every Function Ends?**

1. **Performance Considerations**:
    
    - Running the garbage collector after every function would severely impact performance, as garbage collection is a time-consuming operation.
    - The JVM optimizes GC runs to minimize overhead and maximize efficiency.
2. **Heap Management**:
    
    - Functions often create temporary objects, but these are usually cleaned up in the **young generation** during **minor GC**, which happens periodically—not after every function.
