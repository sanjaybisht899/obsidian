### **Transactional in Spring Boot

#### **1. What is `@Transactional`?**

- `@Transactional` is an annotation in Spring Boot that manages transactions automatically.
- Ensures that all operations within a transaction **commit** successfully or **roll back** on failure.

#### **2. Why is it Used?**

- Ensures **data consistency** in case of errors.
- Prevents **partial updates** to the database.
- Reduces boilerplate code for handling transactions manually.

#### **3. Is it Mandatory?**

- **No**, but highly recommended for database operations that require atomicity.
- Without it, errors may leave the database in an **inconsistent state**.

#### **4. How to Use It?**

- Apply `@Transactional` at the **method** or **class level**.
- Works with Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and JDBC.

```java
@Service
public class OrderService {

    @Transactional
    public void placeOrder() {
        // Step 1: Deduct inventory
        // Step 2: Save order details
        // Step 3: Process payment
        // If any step fails, rollback occurs
    }
}
```

#### **5. What Does It Ensure?**

âœ… **Atomicity** - All steps execute as a single unit.  
âœ… **Consistency** - Data remains valid even if an error occurs.  
âœ… **Isolation** - Prevents conflicts between concurrent transactions.  
âœ… **Durability** - Changes are saved permanently on success.

#### **6. Propagation Types (Why Are They Needed?)**

- Defines how a method should behave in an **existing** transaction.

|Propagation Type|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`REQUIRED`|Uses existing transaction or creates a new one. (Default)|
|`REQUIRES_NEW`|Always creates a new transaction, suspending the existing one.|
|`SUPPORTS`|Uses existing transaction if available, otherwise runs without one.|
|`NOT_SUPPORTED`|Runs outside any transaction.|
|`MANDATORY`|Must run inside an existing transaction, else throws an error.|
|`NEVER`|Must not run inside a transaction, else throws an error.|
|`NESTED`|Creates a sub-transaction inside the existing one.|

âœ… **Use Cases:**

- `REQUIRES_NEW` â†’ When you want an independent transaction (e.g., logging).
- `NESTED` â†’ When rollback should affect only a specific part, not the entire transaction.
