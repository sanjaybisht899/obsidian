Maven:

1. What it is: A build automation tool for Java projects.
2. Key Features:
	- XML-based configuration (pom.xml file).
	- Dependency management: Automatically downloads libraries.
	- Lifecycle management: Defines build phases (e.g., compile, test, package).

3. Advantages:

	- Standardized: Widely adopted, good for consistent builds.
	- Easy to use: Simple XML setup for configuration.

6. Disadvantages:

	- Slower builds.
	- Less flexibility compared to Gradle.

8. When to use: Best for traditional Java projects with standardized build processes.

Gradle:

1. What it is: A flexible, modern build automation tool.
2. Key Features:

	- Groovy/Kotlin-based configuration (build.gradle file).
	- Dependency management: Uses Maven or Ivy repositories.
	- Incremental builds: Optimized for speed, only rebuilds whatâ€™s necessary.

4. Advantages:

	- Faster: Incremental builds and parallel execution.
	- Flexible: Can build anything (not just Java).
	- Customizable: Can define complex build logic easily.

6. Disadvantages:

	- Steeper learning curve due to Groovy/Kotlin syntax.
	- Less standardised than Maven.

8. When to use: Ideal for complex projects, multi-language builds, or when build performance is critical.

Key Differences:

- Maven: Simpler, standardized, XML-based configuration, suitable for traditional Java projects.
- Gradle: More flexible and faster, Groovy/Kotlin-based configuration, better for complex or multi-language projects.
