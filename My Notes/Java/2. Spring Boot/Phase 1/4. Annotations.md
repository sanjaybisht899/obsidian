1. @SpringBootApplication:

	- What it is: A composite annotation that simplifies the configuration of a Spring Boot application.
	- Shortcuts for:
	
	- @Configuration: Marks the class as a source of bean definitions.
	- @ComponentScan: Scans for Spring components (beans) in the package and sub-packages.
	- @EnableAutoConfiguration: Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration feature, which automatically configures your application based on dependencies.

2. @Controller vs. @RestController:

	- @Controller:
	
		- Use: For handling web requests and rendering views (e.g., JSP, HTML).
		- Returns: Views (HTML, JSP files).
		- Example: Typically used in MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
	
	- @RestController:
	
		- Use: A more specific version of @Controller, used for building RESTful APIs.
		- Returns: Data in JSON or XML format (automatically serialized).
		- Example: Used in REST APIs.

3. @Service:

	- What it is: Indicates a service class, typically used for business logic.
	- Use: Marks a service layer that contains core business logic.
	- Example: Can be injected into other components like controllers.

4. @Repository:

	- What it is: Indicates a class responsible for data access logic.
	- Use: Typically used with JPA repositories, it handles data persistence and integrates with databases.
	- Example: Marks a class as a data access object (DAO).

5. Other Important Spring Boot Annotations:

	- @Autowired:
		- What it is: Automatically injects the required dependency into a class.
		- Use: Used on constructors, fields, or setter methods.
		- Example: Injects services, repositories, or other beans into a class.

	- @Value:
		- What it is: Injects values from properties files into fields.
		- Use: Can be used to inject values from application properties or environment variables.
		- Example: @Value("${server.port}")

	- @Bean:
		- What it is: Defines a Spring bean inside a configuration class.
		- Use: Used inside a @Configuration class to create a bean manually.
		- Example: @Bean public DataSource dataSource() {...}

	- @Configuration:
		- What it is: Marks a class as a source of Spring Bean definitions.
		- Use: Used to define Java-based configuration (alternative to XML configuration).
		- Example: Contains methods annotated with @Bean.

	- @Component:
		- What it is: Generic annotation for defining beans.
		- Use: Indicates a class as a Spring-managed component.
		- Example: Can be used on any class to indicate it's a Spring Bean.

	- @Valid:
		- What it is: Triggers validation of a bean or object.
		- Use: Validates an object based on constraints defined using annotations like @NotNull, @Size, etc.
		- Example: @PostMapping("/user") public ResponseEntity createUser(@Valid @RequestBody User user) {...}

	- @EnableAutoConfiguration:
		- What it is: Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration feature.
		- Use: Automatically configures application components based on dependencies.
		- Example: Usually included in @SpringBootApplication.
