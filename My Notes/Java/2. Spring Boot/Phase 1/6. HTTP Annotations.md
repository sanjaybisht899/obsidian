# Spring Boot REST Controller Example

## 1. Controller Class Overview

This controller handles HTTP requests for a REST API. It demonstrates various HTTP methods and their use cases in Spring Boot.

---

## 2. Code Example: API Controller

```java
// Import necessary Spring Boot annotations and classes
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

// Controller class to handle HTTP requests
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ApiController {

    // Handle GET request – Retrieve a list of items
    @GetMapping("/items")
    public List<Item> getItems() {
        // Logic to return list of items
        return itemService.getAllItems();
    }

    // Handle GET request – Retrieve an item by ID
    @GetMapping("/items/{id}")
    public Item getItemById(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to fetch item by ID
        return itemService.getItemById(id);
    }

    // Handle POST request – Create a new item
    @PostMapping("/items")
    public Item createItem(@RequestBody Item newItem) {
        // Logic to create and return the new item
        return itemService.createItem(newItem);
    }

    // Handle PUT request – Update an existing item by ID
    @PutMapping("/items/{id}")
    public Item updateItem(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Item updatedItem) {
        // Logic to update item by ID
        return itemService.updateItem(id, updatedItem);
    }

    // Handle DELETE request – Delete an item by ID
    @DeleteMapping("/items/{id}")
    public void deleteItem(@PathVariable Long id) {
        // Logic to delete item by ID
        itemService.deleteItem(id);
    }

    // Handle PATCH request – Partially update an item
    @PatchMapping("/items/{id}")
    public Item patchItem(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Item partialUpdate) {
        // Logic to partially update item
        return itemService.patchItem(id, partialUpdate);
    }

    // Handle custom request mapping with a specific HTTP method
    @RequestMapping(value = "/items", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<Item> getItemsCustom() {
        // Custom logic for GET request
        return itemService.getAllItems();
    }
}
```

## 3. What is Patching?

### **Definition**:

- Patching refers to making **partial updates** to a resource, where only specific fields or attributes of the resource are modified.

### **Usage**:

- Typically used when you don’t want to send the entire resource but only the fields that need modification.

### **How It Works**:

- The request body contains **only the fields you want to change**, not the whole resource.
- Fields not included in the PATCH request **remain unchanged**.

### **Example**:

For a user resource, if you only want to update the email address while keeping the rest of the user details unchanged, the request would look like this:

#### Request Body:

```json
{
  "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

---

## Summary

- **GET**: Retrieve data.
- **POST**: Create new resources.
- **PUT**: Fully update existing resources.
- **DELETE**: Remove resources.
- **PATCH**: Partially update resources.

# Questions

## What are the common HTTP status codes?

---

### **1xx – Informational Responses** (Rarely used)

- **100 Continue** – The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed with the request.
- **101 Switching Protocols** – The server agrees to switch protocols as requested by the client.

---

### **2xx – Success** ✅

- **200 OK** – The request was successful, and the server returned the expected response.
- **201 Created** – The request successfully created a new resource.
- **204 No Content** – The request was successful, but there is no content to send in response.

---

### **3xx – Redirection** 🔄

- **301 Moved Permanently** – The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.
- **302 Found** – The requested resource is temporarily at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified** – The resource hasn't changed since the last request (used for caching).

---

### **4xx – Client Errors** 🚨

- **400 Bad Request** – The request is invalid or malformed.
- **401 Unauthorized** – Authentication is required but has failed or hasn't been provided.
- **403 Forbidden** – The client is authenticated but doesn’t have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found** – The requested resource does not exist.
- **405 Method Not Allowed** – The request method (e.g., GET, POST) is not supported for the resource.
- **409 Conflict** – The request conflicts with the current state of the server (e.g., trying to create a duplicate resource).

---

### **5xx – Server Errors** 🔥

- **500 Internal Server Error** – A general error when the server fails to process the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway** – The server acting as a gateway received an invalid response from an upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable** – The server is temporarily overloaded or down for maintenance.
- **504 Gateway Timeout** – The server didn't receive a response from the upstream server in time.

---

### **Most Common in Real-world Usage**

✅ **200 OK** – Success  
❌ **400 Bad Request** – Invalid input  
🔑 **401 Unauthorized** – Login required  
🚫 **403 Forbidden** – Access denied  
🔍 **404 Not Found** – Resource missing
