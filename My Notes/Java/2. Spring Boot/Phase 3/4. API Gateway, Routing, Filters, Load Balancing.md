#### **1. What is an API Gateway?**

- **Definition**: API Gateway is a centralized entry point for all client requests to backend services. It handles tasks like routing, filtering, authentication, and monitoring.
- **Role in Microservices**:
    - Manages communication between clients and multiple services.
    - Simplifies client logic by abstracting service locations and complexities.
    - Improves performance with caching, rate-limiting, and load balancing.

**Key Points for Interviews**:

- Centralized control for all microservices.
- Improves security by handling authentication and authorization.
- Helps manage cross-cutting concerns like logging and monitoring.

#### **2. What is Spring Cloud Gateway?**

- **Definition**: Spring Cloud Gateway is a lightweight and reactive API Gateway built on top of Spring WebFlux. Itâ€™s designed to replace Zuul.
- **Features**:
    1. Routing requests to appropriate microservices.
    2. Filtering requests and responses.
    3. Support for load balancing, rate limiting, and retries.
    4. Built-in support for **WebSocket**.

**Key Points for Interviews**:

- Reactive programming model using Project Reactor.
- Declarative route configuration using `application.yml`.

#### **3. Setting Up Spring Cloud Gateway**

1. **Add Dependencies**:
    
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    ```
    
2. **Create the Main Application**:
    
    - Add `@SpringBootApplication` in the main class.
    
    ```java
    @SpringBootApplication
    public class GatewayApplication {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            SpringApplication.run(GatewayApplication.class, args);
        }
    }
    ```
    
3. **Configure Routes**:
    
    - Define routing in `application.yml`.
    
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: service-a-route
              uri: http://localhost:8081
              predicates:
                - Path=/service-a/**
              filters:
                - StripPrefix=1
    
            - id: service-b-route
              uri: http://localhost:8082
              predicates:
                - Path=/service-b/**
    ```
    

**Key Points for Interviews**:

- **URI**: Specifies the target service (e.g., `http://localhost:8081`).
- **Predicates**: Conditions for routing (e.g., match a specific path).
- **Filters**: Modify requests or responses (e.g., `StripPrefix` removes the first part of the path).

---

#### **4. How Routing Works in Spring Cloud Gateway**

1. **Client sends a request**: E.g., `http://localhost:8080/service-a/endpoint`.
2. **Gateway matches the route**: Based on predicates like path.
3. **Request is forwarded**: Gateway sends the request to the service (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/endpoint`).
4. **Response is sent back**: Gateway modifies the response (if filters are applied) and sends it to the client.

---

#### **5. Configuring Filters**

Filters allow you to modify requests and responses. Some common filters include:

1. **StripPrefix**: Removes a part of the request path.
    
    ```yaml
    filters:
      - StripPrefix=1
    ```
    
2. **AddRequestHeader**: Adds a header to the request.
    
    ```yaml
    filters:
      - AddRequestHeader=X-Request-Id,1234
    ```
    
3. **RewritePath**: Rewrites part of the request path.
    
    ```yaml
    filters:
      - RewritePath=/service-a/(?<segment>.*), /${segment}
    ```
    

**Key Points for Interviews**:

- Filters can be global (apply to all routes) or route-specific.
- Use filters to implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, rate-limiting, or authentication.

#### **6. Handling Load Balancing**

- Spring Cloud Gateway integrates with **Eureka** for service discovery and load balancing.
- **Dynamic Routing Example**:
    
    ```yaml
    spring:
      cloud:
        gateway:
          routes:
            - id: service-a
              uri: lb://service-a
              predicates:
                - Path=/service-a/**
    ```
    

**Explanation**:

- The `lb://` prefix enables load balancing for services registered in Eureka.
- Requests are distributed across available instances.
