### **Trace vs Span in Logs**

âœ… **Trace:** Represents the **entire journey** of a request across multiple microservices. It tracks the flow **end-to-end**.

âœ… **Span:** Represents a **single operation** within a trace, like an API call or a database query. A trace consists of multiple spans.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**

- A user request hits Service A â†’ Calls Service B â†’ Calls Service C.
- **One Trace ID** links all services.
- Each service creates a **Span ID** for its part in the process.

### How can we track the flow of API calls across multiple microservices in a Spring Boot application?

You can track API calls across multiple microservices in a **Spring Boot** application using **Distributed Tracing** tools like:

âœ… **Spring Cloud Sleuth** â€“ Adds trace IDs and spans to logs.  
âœ… **Zipkin / Jaeger** â€“ Collects and visualizes traces.  
âœ… **OpenTelemetry** â€“ Standardized tracing solution.  
âœ… **Log Correlation** â€“ Use MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context) for consistent logging.

If you want to **track API calls across microservices without any tool**, you can do it manually by:

âœ… **Passing a Unique ID (Trace ID) in Headers**

- Generate a **UUID** in the first microservice.
- Pass it in API requests as a custom header (e.g., `X-Trace-Id`).
- Extract and log it in every microservice.

âœ… **Logging with MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)**

- Store the **Trace ID** in MDC for structured logging.
- Ensure logs include the same Trace ID across services.

âœ… **Use a Centralized Logging System**

- Even without tools like Zipkin, store logs in a **shared location** (database, file, or logging service).
