#### **Lazy Loading:**

- **Definition**: In lazy loading, the related data (in this case, `answers`) is not loaded until it is specifically accessed or requested.
- **Configuration**: Default behavior in JPA/Hibernate when no `fetch` type is specified.
- **Behavior**: The `answers` collection is loaded **only** when `getAnswers()` is called.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    Question q = (Question) session.get(Question.class, 1);
    System.out.println(q.getAnswers().size());  // This triggers a separate query to load answers
    ```
    
- **Output**:
    - A separate SQL query is executed to fetch `answers` only when it's accessed.
    - **Example SQL query**:
        
        ```
        Hibernate: 
          select
            question0_.question_id as question1_4_0_,
            question0_.question as question2_4_0_
          from
            question0_
          where
            question0_.question_id=?
        Hibernate: 
          select
            answers0_.ques_id as ques_id3_0_0_,
            answers0_.answer_id as answer_i1_0_0_,
            answers0_.answer as answer2_0_0_
          from
            answers0_
          where
            answers0_.ques_id=?
        ```
        

---

#### **Eager Loading:**

- **Definition**: In eager loading, the related data (`answers`) is immediately loaded along with the main entity (`Question`) when the object is retrieved from the database.
- **Configuration**: Achieved using `fetch = FetchType.EAGER` in JPA/Hibernate.
- **Behavior**: The `answers` collection is loaded **as soon as** the `Question` object is accessed.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    Question q = (Question) session.get(Question.class, 1);
    System.out.println(q.getAnswers().size());  // Answers are loaded immediately with the Question object
    ```
    
- **Output**:
    - The `answers` collection is already populated, and no additional SQL query is needed to fetch them.
    - **Example SQL query**:
        
        ```
        Hibernate: 
          select
            question0_.question_id as question1_4_0_,
            question0_.question as question2_4_0_
          from
            question0_
          where
            question0_.question_id=?
        Hibernate: 
          select
            answers1_.ques_id as ques_id3_0_1_,
            answers1_.answer_id as answer_i1_0_1_,
            answers1_.answer as answer2_0_1_
          from
            answers1_
          where
            answers1_.ques_id=1
        ```

### **Table Comparison:**

|**Lazy Loading**|**Eager Loading**|
|---|---|
|Default behavior in JPA if `fetch` is not specified.|Not default; explicitly defined by `fetch = FetchType.EAGER`.|
|Related data (e.g., `answers`) is loaded **only** when accessed.|Related data (`answers`) is loaded **immediately** with the main object.|
|A separate query is executed **later** to fetch the related data.|All related data (`answers`) is fetched **with** the main object, no extra query needed.|
|**Lazy** query behavior; executes on-demand.|**Eager** query behavior; executes immediately.|

### **Explanation of Code:**

- **Answer.java**: Represents an entity for `Answer`, which is linked to a `Question` using `ManyToOne`.
- **Question.java**: Represents an entity for `Question`, which has a one-to-many relationship with `Answer`. The `fetch` type in `@OneToMany` is `FetchType.EAGER`, meaning related answers are loaded immediately with the `Question`.
- **MapDemo.java**: Demonstrates how to fetch a `Question` from the database and then retrieve associated `Answer` objects.

# Questions

#### **18. What Are the Different Fetching Strategies in Hibernate?**

Hibernate provides three main fetching strategies to control how data is retrieved from the database:

1. **Eager Fetching:**
    
    - Data is fetched **immediately** when the parent entity is loaded.
    - It retrieves associated entities even if they are not explicitly accessed.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
        private List<Order> orders;
        ```
        
2. **Lazy Fetching:**
    
    - Associated data is fetched **only when accessed**.
    - Reduces initial load time by deferring associated data retrieval.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
        private List<Order> orders;
        ```
        
3. **Join Fetching (HQL/Criteria):**
    
    - Uses SQL `JOIN` to fetch parent and associated entities in a single query.
    - Reduces the number of database hits.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Query query = session.createQuery("SELECT c FROM Customer c JOIN FETCH c.orders");
        ```

#### **19. What Is the Difference Between Immediate Fetching and Lazy Collection Fetching?**

|**Aspect**|**Immediate Fetching (Eager)**|**Lazy Collection Fetching**|
|---|---|---|
|**Retrieval Timing**|Retrieves associated data immediately.|Retrieves associated data only when accessed.|
|**Performance**|May load unnecessary data, increasing overhead.|Reduces initial load time by deferring data fetch.|
|**Database Queries**|Executes additional queries or joins upfront.|Fetches associated data when accessed explicitly.|
|**Use Case**|For data that is always needed.|For large or infrequently accessed data.|

---

#### **20. What Is ‘Extra Lazy Fetching’ in Hibernate?**

**Extra Lazy Fetching** is an extension of lazy fetching that optimizes the way Hibernate interacts with large collections. Instead of fetching the entire collection, it fetches only the required parts, such as specific elements or the collection size.

- **Key Features:**
    
    - Collection size is fetched with a separate query.
    - Single elements are fetched without initializing the entire collection.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    @OneToMany(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @LazyCollection(LazyCollectionOption.EXTRA)
    private List<Order> orders;
    
    // Fetches only the size, not the whole collection
    int size = orders.size();
    ```
    

---

#### **21. How Can We Check if a Collection Is Initialized or Not Under Lazy Initialization Strategy?**

Hibernate provides the **`Hibernate.isInitialized()`** method to check whether a lazy collection or proxy object has been initialized.

- **Usage Example:**
    
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Customer customer = session.get(Customer.class, 1);
    
    // Check if the 'orders' collection is initialized
    boolean isInitialized = Hibernate.isInitialized(customer.getOrders());
    
    if (!isInitialized) {
        System.out.println("The orders collection is not yet initialized.");
    } else {
        System.out.println("The orders collection is initialized.");
    }
    ```
    
- **Why Use It?**
    
    - Prevents triggering an unintended database query by accessing a lazy-loaded collection.
    - Helps optimize performance by explicitly controlling when to initialize collections.

### **Summary Table**

|**Fetching Strategy**|**Purpose**|**Example Use Case**|
|---|---|---|
|**Eager Fetching**|Retrieve associated data immediately.|Small, frequently accessed data.|
|**Lazy Fetching**|Retrieve data only when accessed.|Large or infrequently accessed data.|
|**Extra Lazy Fetching**|Optimize fetching for large collections.|Collections where only parts are frequently needed.|
