|**State**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Transient**|Object is created but not associated with Hibernate (not saved in DB).|
|**Persistent**|Object is saved in DB and managed by Hibernate (tracked for changes).|
|**Detached**|Object was persistent but is now removed from Hibernate session (not tracked).|
|**Removed**|Object is marked for deletion; it will be deleted when the transaction commits.|

### **1️⃣ Transient State:** _(Not Managed by Hibernate)_

- The object is created but not yet saved in the database.
- Hibernate is unaware of it.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    User user = new User();  // New object created (Transient state)
    user.setId(1);
    user.setName("John");
    // Not yet saved, Hibernate does not track it.
    ```

---

### **2️⃣ Persistent State:** _(Managed by Hibernate, Saved in DB)_

- The object is saved in the database.
- Hibernate tracks changes and synchronizes them with DB.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
    
    User user = new User();  
    user.setId(1);
    user.setName("John");
    
    session.save(user); // Now Hibernate manages this object (Persistent)
    tx.commit(); // Data is stored in the database
    session.close();
    ```
    

---

### **3️⃣ Detached State:** _(No Longer Managed, Still Exists in DB)_

- The object **still exists in the DB**, but Hibernate **no longer tracks it**.
    
- Any modifications **will not be saved** unless explicitly reattached.
    
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    session.close(); // Closing session, object becomes Detached
    
    user.setName("Updated Name"); // Change is made, but Hibernate does NOT track it
    ```
    
- To persist changes, we **merge** it back:
    
    ```java
    session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    tx = session.beginTransaction();
    session.merge(user); // Hibernate starts tracking it again
    tx.commit();
    session.close();
    ```
    

---

### **4️⃣ Removed State:** _(Marked for Deletion, Deleted on Commit)_

- The object is marked for deletion but **still exists in DB until the commit**.
- Once `commit()` is called, it is permanently deleted.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    tx = session.beginTransaction();
    
    session.delete(user); // Marked for removal
    // Still exists in DB until commit
    
    tx.commit(); // Permanently deleted from DB
    session.close();
    ```

#### **ObjectStates.java**

```java
package com.tut.ProjectWithMaven;

import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;

public class ObjectStates {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SessionFactory factory = new Configuration().configure("hibernate.cfg.xml").buildSessionFactory();
        
        // Practical example of Hibernate Object States: Transient, Persistent, Detached, Removed

        // Transient state: Creating a new object and performing operations before it is saved.
        Student student = new Student();
        student.setId(1);
        student.setName("Ram");
        student.setCity("Ayodhya");
        student.setCourse(new Course("Java Course", "1 Day"));
        
        // Student in Transient state
        Session session = factory.openSession();
        
        Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
        session.save(student);  // student: Persistent -- it is now managed by Hibernate (session, database)
        tx.commit();
        
        // Detached state: Closing the session disconnects the object from Hibernate.
        session.close();
        
        // Removed state: Deleting the object.
        session = factory.openSession();
        tx = session.beginTransaction();
        session.delete(student);  // Student: Removed -- not in database or session anymore
        tx.commit();
        session.close();
        
        factory.close();
    }
}

    public Student(int id, String name, String city) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
        this.city = city;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Student [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", city=" + city + "]";
    }

### **Explanation and Workflow**:

- **Transient State**: Objects created but not yet associated with the database or session.
- **Persistent State**: Objects that have been saved to the database and are currently managed by Hibernate.
- **Detached State**: Objects that were previously persistent but have now been disconnected from Hibernate.
- **Removed State**: Objects deleted from both the database and Hibernate's session.



# Questions

#### **1. What is the Transient State of an Object in Hibernate?**

In Hibernate, an object is in the **Transient state** when it is created using the `new` keyword but is **not yet associated with a Hibernate session** or saved in the database.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - The object is not linked to any database record.
    - It does not have a persistent identity (primary key value).
    - It is simply a Java object in memory.
    - If the application ends, the object will be garbage collected unless explicitly saved.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Employee emp = new Employee(); // Transient state
    emp.setName("John");
    emp.setEmail("john@example.com");
    ```
    

---

#### **2. What is the Detached State of an Object in Hibernate?**

An object is in the **Detached state** when it was previously associated with a Hibernate session (and persisted to the database), but the session has been closed or the object is no longer managed by Hibernate.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - The object has a persistent identity (primary key value).
    - It still represents a database record, but changes to it will not be automatically synchronized with the database.
    - To persist changes, the object must be re-attached to an active session.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, 1); // Persistent state
    session.close(); // Session is closed, emp is now in the Detached state
    emp.setEmail("newemail@example.com"); // Changes are not persisted
    ```
    

---

#### **11. In Hibernate, How Can an Object Go into a Detached State?**

An object can transition to a **Detached state** in the following scenarios:

1. **Session Close:**
    
    - When the session managing the object is explicitly closed.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, 1);
        session.close(); // emp is now Detached
        ```
        
2. **Session Clear/Evict:**
    
    - When the session is cleared or the specific object is evicted from the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.evict(emp); // emp is evicted and becomes Detached
        session.clear(); // All objects are Detached
        ```
        
3. **Transaction Commit:**
    
    - Depending on the configuration, committing a transaction can cause objects to detach.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.getTransaction().commit();
        ```

#### **12. How Will You Re-Attach an Object in a Detached State in Hibernate?**

To re-attach a **Detached object** to an active Hibernate session, the following methods can be used:

1. **`session.update()`**
    
    - Re-attaches the object and updates it in the database.
    - If the object exists in the database, it will throw an exception if there is already a persistent instance with the same identifier in the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        session.update(emp); // Re-attached and updates the database
        session.close();
        ```
        
2. **`session.merge()`**
    
    - Merges the Detached object with the current session and synchronizes changes with the database.
    - Unlike `update()`, it does not throw an exception if there is a persistent object with the same identifier in the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        session.merge(emp); // Re-attached and merged
        session.close();
        ```
        
3. **`session.lock()`**
    
    - Locks the Detached object to associate it with the current session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.lock(emp, LockMode.NONE);
        ```
        
4. **Re-retrieve the Object:**
    
    - Retrieve the object from the database using the same identifier to get a new Persistent instance.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, emp.getId());
        ```

**Summary Table:**

|**State**|**Description**|**How to Transition?**|
|---|---|---|
|**Transient**|New object, not associated with a session or database|Save or persist the object|
|**Persistent**|Associated with a session and synchronized with the database|Automatic after `save()`, `persist()`, or retrieval|
|**Detached**|Previously Persistent but now disassociated|Reattach using `update()`, `merge()`|
