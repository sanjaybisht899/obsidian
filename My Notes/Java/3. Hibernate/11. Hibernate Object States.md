**1. Transient State**

- **Definition**: When a new object is created but not yet associated with a session or saved to the database.
- **Characteristics**:
    - The object exists only in memory (not saved in the database or session).
    - Any changes made to this object will not reflect in the database.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    Student student = new Student();
    student.setId(1);
    student.setName("Ram");
    student.setCity("Ayodhya");
    student.setCourse(new Course("Java Course","1 Day"));
    ```

**2. Persistent State**

- **Definition**: An object that is associated with a session and has been saved into the database.
- **Characteristics**:
    - The object exists in both the database and the session.
    - Changes made to this object within the session will automatically be updated in the database when `save`, `persist`, or `saveOrUpdate` is called.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    Session session = factory.openSession();
    Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
    session.save(student);  // Student goes into Persistent state
    tx.commit();
    ```
    

---

**3. Detached State**

- **Definition**: An object that was previously in the persistent state but now exists in the database, yet is not associated with any session.
- **Characteristics**:
    - The object still exists in the database but is no longer managed by Hibernateâ€™s session.
    - To re-attach this object to the session, you must call `update` or `save` again.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    session.close();  // The session is closed, the object goes into Detached state
    ```
    

---

**4. Removed State**

- **Definition**: An object that was in persistent state and has been deleted from both the database and the session.
- **Characteristics**:
    - The object is removed from both the database and Hibernate's session.
- **Example**:
    
    ```java
    session.delete(student);  // Student goes into Removed state
    tx.commit();
    session.close();
    ```

### **Explanation with Code:**

#### **ObjectStates.java**

```java
package com.tut.ProjectWithMaven;

import org.hibernate.Session;
import org.hibernate.SessionFactory;
import org.hibernate.Transaction;
import org.hibernate.cfg.Configuration;

public class ObjectStates {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SessionFactory factory = new Configuration().configure("hibernate.cfg.xml").buildSessionFactory();
        
        // Practical example of Hibernate Object States: Transient, Persistent, Detached, Removed

        // Transient state: Creating a new object and performing operations before it is saved.
        Student student = new Student();
        student.setId(1);
        student.setName("Ram");
        student.setCity("Ayodhya");
        student.setCourse(new Course("Java Course", "1 Day"));
        
        // Student in Transient state
        Session session = factory.openSession();
        
        Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
        session.save(student);  // student: Persistent -- it is now managed by Hibernate (session, database)
        tx.commit();
        
        // Detached state: Closing the session disconnects the object from Hibernate.
        session.close();
        
        // Removed state: Deleting the object.
        session = factory.openSession();
        tx = session.beginTransaction();
        session.delete(student);  // Student: Removed -- not in database or session anymore
        tx.commit();
        session.close();
        
        factory.close();
    }
}

        this.city = city;
    }
    
    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Student [id=" + id + ", name=" + name + ", city=" + city + "]";
    }
}

### **Explanation and Workflow**:

- **Transient State**: Objects created but not yet associated with the database or session.
- **Persistent State**: Objects that have been saved to the database and are currently managed by Hibernate.
- **Detached State**: Objects that were previously persistent but have now been disconnected from Hibernate.
- **Removed State**: Objects deleted from both the database and Hibernate's session.



# Questions

#### **1. What is the Transient State of an Object in Hibernate?**

In Hibernate, an object is in the **Transient state** when it is created using the `new` keyword but is **not yet associated with a Hibernate session** or saved in the database.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - The object is not linked to any database record.
    - It does not have a persistent identity (primary key value).
    - It is simply a Java object in memory.
    - If the application ends, the object will be garbage collected unless explicitly saved.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Employee emp = new Employee(); // Transient state
    emp.setName("John");
    emp.setEmail("john@example.com");
    ```
    

---

#### **2. What is the Detached State of an Object in Hibernate?**

An object is in the **Detached state** when it was previously associated with a Hibernate session (and persisted to the database), but the session has been closed or the object is no longer managed by Hibernate.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - The object has a persistent identity (primary key value).
    - It still represents a database record, but changes to it will not be automatically synchronized with the database.
    - To persist changes, the object must be re-attached to an active session.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, 1); // Persistent state
    session.close(); // Session is closed, emp is now in the Detached state
    emp.setEmail("newemail@example.com"); // Changes are not persisted
    ```

#### **11. In Hibernate, How Can an Object Go into a Detached State?**

An object can transition to a **Detached state** in the following scenarios:

1. **Session Close:**
    
    - When the session managing the object is explicitly closed.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, 1);
        session.close(); // emp is now Detached
        ```
        
2. **Session Clear/Evict:**
    
    - When the session is cleared or the specific object is evicted from the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.evict(emp); // emp is evicted and becomes Detached
        session.clear(); // All objects are Detached
        ```
        
3. **Transaction Commit:**
    
    - Depending on the configuration, committing a transaction can cause objects to detach.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.getTransaction().commit();
        ```

#### **12. How Will You Re-Attach an Object in a Detached State in Hibernate?**

To re-attach a **Detached object** to an active Hibernate session, the following methods can be used:

1. **`session.update()`**
    
    - Re-attaches the object and updates it in the database.
    - If the object exists in the database, it will throw an exception if there is already a persistent instance with the same identifier in the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        session.update(emp); // Re-attached and updates the database
        session.close();
        ```
        
2. **`session.merge()`**
    
    - Merges the Detached object with the current session and synchronizes changes with the database.
    - Unlike `update()`, it does not throw an exception if there is a persistent object with the same identifier in the session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
        session.merge(emp); // Re-attached and merged
        session.close();
        ```
        
3. **`session.lock()`**
    
    - Locks the Detached object to associate it with the current session.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        session.lock(emp, LockMode.NONE);
        ```
        
4. **Re-retrieve the Object:**
    
    - Retrieve the object from the database using the same identifier to get a new Persistent instance.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Employee emp = session.get(Employee.class, emp.getId());
        ```
