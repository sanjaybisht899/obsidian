### **Microservices Overview**

Microservices is an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of **small, independent services** that communicate with each other over APIs. Each microservice is designed for a specific functionality and can be **developed, deployed, and scaled independently**.

### **Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture**

| Feature               | Monolithic Architecture                   | Microservices Architecture                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structure**         | Single codebase, tightly coupled          | Multiple independent services                     |
| **Scalability**       | Hard to scale parts individually          | Easily scalable per service                       |
| **Deployment**        | Entire app needs to be deployed together  | Independent deployment of services                |
| **Technology**        | Limited to one tech stack                 | Different services can use different technologies |
| **Development Speed** | Slower, especially as the app grows       | Faster development and deployment cycles          |
| **Fault Isolation**   | A single failure can impact the whole app | Failures are isolated to individual services      |
| **Maintenance**       | Becomes difficult as codebase grows       | Easier to maintain and update specific services   |
| **Performance**       | Can be faster within a single system      | Might have network overhead due to API calls      |

### **How to Convert a Monolith to Microservices?**

1. **Identify Boundaries** → Break down the monolith into **functional domains** (e.g., User Service, Order Service).
2. **Extract Microservices Gradually** → Start with **less critical** components and **gradually extract** them into separate services.
3. **Use an API Gateway** → Centralize request handling and route traffic to appropriate services.
4. **Decouple Database** → Move from a **shared monolithic database** to **separate databases** per service.
5. **Implement Inter-Service Communication** → Use REST, gRPC, or message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
6. **Ensure Security & Monitoring** → Implement authentication (OAuth, JWT) and observability (logs, metrics, tracing).
7. **CI/CD & Automation** → Automate deployment, testing, and monitoring.

### **Challenges of Microservices**

8. **Increased Complexity** → More services mean more moving parts, requiring proper **orchestration and monitoring**.
9. **Data Management** → Handling **distributed transactions** across multiple databases is difficult.
10. **Inter-Service Communication** → API calls between services can introduce **latency** and **failures**.
11. **Deployment Overhead** → Managing multiple services requires **containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)**.
12. **Security Risks** → More services increase attack surfaces, requiring **proper authentication and authorization**.
13. **Testing Difficulties** → End-to-end testing becomes more complex with multiple services interacting.
