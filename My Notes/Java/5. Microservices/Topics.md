### **2. Communication Patterns (How Microservices Talk to Each Other)**

**Goal**: Ensure microservices can communicate efficiently and handle failures.

ðŸ“Œ **API Gateway** â€“ A single entry point that routes requests to different microservices.

- _Example_: A **Netflix API Gateway** takes requests from mobile/web apps and routes them to the correct services (e.g., movie catalog, user profile, recommendations).

ðŸ“Œ **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** â€“ Different APIs for different front-end clients.

- _Example_: A **mobile app API** may return lighter responses, while a **web app API** provides more detailed data.

ðŸ“Œ **Circuit Breaker** â€“ Prevents failures from cascading.

- _Example_: If the **Payment Service** is down, the circuit breaker will **stop calling it** and return a friendly error message instead of crashing the system.

### **3. Data Management Patterns (Handling Databases in Microservices)**

**Goal**: Ensure each microservice manages its data properly without conflicts.

ðŸ“Œ **Database per Service** â€“ Each microservice has its own database.

- _Example_: The **Orders service** has a PostgreSQL database, and the **Inventory service** uses MongoDB.

ðŸ“Œ **Saga Pattern** â€“ Handle transactions across multiple services using events.

- _Example_: In a flight booking system:
    1. **Payment Service** deducts money â†’
    2. **Booking Service** confirms the ticket â†’
    3. If step 2 fails, **Payment Service** refunds the money.

ðŸ“Œ **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** â€“ Separate read and write operations.

- _Example_: **E-commerce orders** - Write requests go to a **SQL database**, and read requests fetch data from a **cached NoSQL database** for faster access.

ðŸ“Œ **Event Sourcing** â€“ Store all changes as events instead of updating a record.

- _Example_: Instead of updating an **order status** from "Pending" to "Shipped", store an event:
    - Event 1: "Order Created"
    - Event 2: "Payment Received"
    - Event 3: "Order Shipped"

### **4. Deployment & Resilience Patterns (Ensuring Reliability & Performance)**

**Goal**: Make microservices fault-tolerant and easy to scale.

ðŸ“Œ **Sidecar Pattern** â€“ Attach a helper service to a microservice (e.g., logging, security).

- _Example_: Netflix uses **Envoy Proxy** as a sidecar to handle API traffic for microservices.

ðŸ“Œ **Service Mesh** â€“ A dedicated infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication.

- _Example_: Istio or Linkerd ensures that all microservices communicate securely without extra code in your application.

ðŸ“Œ **Bulkhead Pattern** â€“ Isolate different parts of the system to prevent failures.

- _Example_: If the **Reporting Service** crashes, it doesn't affect the **Payment Service**, because each service runs in its own isolated container.

ðŸ“Œ **Retry & Timeout** â€“ Automatically retry requests and set time limits for responses.

- _Example_: If a payment API call fails due to **network issues**, the system **automatically retries** before giving an error.

---

### **5. Security Patterns (Protecting Microservices)**

**Goal**: Secure APIs, user authentication, and data access.

ðŸ“Œ **OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect** â€“ Secure user authentication.

- _Example_: Logging into an app using **Google or Facebook login**.

ðŸ“Œ **Token-Based Authentication** â€“ Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure communication.

- _Example_: A user logs in â†’ gets a **JWT token** â†’ sends this token in API requests to access data.

ðŸ“Œ **Zero Trust Security** â€“ Always verify requests, even inside the system.

- _Example_: Even if **Service A** is calling **Service B**, it must prove its identity before accessing data.

---

### **6. Observability Patterns (Monitoring & Logging Microservices)**

**Goal**: Track system performance and diagnose failures.

ðŸ“Œ **Centralized Logging** â€“ Collect logs from all microservices in one place.

- _Example_: Use **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)** or **Fluentd** to collect and analyze logs.

ðŸ“Œ **Distributed Tracing** â€“ Track requests as they move through microservices.

- _Example_: Tools like **Jaeger or Zipkin** show the flow of API requests between different services.

ðŸ“Œ **Health Check Endpoint** â€“ Each microservice provides a health status API.

- _Example_: `/health` API returns `"status": "UP"` if the service is running fine.
