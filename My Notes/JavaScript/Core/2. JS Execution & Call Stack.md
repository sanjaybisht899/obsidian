When a JavaScript program runs, a **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created. The execution context is created in two phases:

1. **Memory Creation Phase**: JavaScript allocates memory to variables and functions.
2. **Code Execution Phase**: The code is executed line by line.

#### Example Code:
```javascript
var n = 2;

function square(num) {
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}

var square2 = square(n);
var square4 = square(4);
```

---

### Memory Creation Phase:
- JavaScript scans the code and allocates memory for variables and functions.
    - For `n`, it stores `undefined`.
    - For `square`, it stores the entire function code.
    - For `square2` and `square4`, it stores `undefined`.

#### Memory Layout:
```
Memory:
n: undefined
square: { function code }
square2: undefined
square4: undefined
```

### Code Execution Phase:
- JavaScript executes the code line by line.
    - `var n = 2`: Assigns `2` to `n`.
    - For `square(n)`, a **new execution context** is created:
        - **Memory Creation Phase**:
            - Allocates memory for `num` and `ans` (both initially `undefined`).
        - **Code Execution Phase**:
            - Assigns `2` to `num`.
            - Calculates `ans = num * num` and stores `4` in `ans`.
            - Returns `ans` to the calling context.
    - The same process repeats for `square(4)`.
    - Once the function execution is complete, its execution context is deleted.

---

### Call Stack:
- JavaScript uses a **Call Stack** to manage the execution of multiple functions.
- The Call Stack keeps track of the order in which execution contexts are created and deleted.
- It is also known as:
    - Program Stack
    - Control Stack
    - Runtime Stack
    - Machine Stack
    - Execution Context Stack

### Final Memory Layout Before Deletion:
```
Memory:
n: 2
square: { function code }
square2: 4
square4: 16
```
