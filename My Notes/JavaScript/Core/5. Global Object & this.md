# Shortest JS Program, `window`, and `this` Keyword

- The **shortest JavaScript program** is an **empty file**. Even in this case, the JavaScript engine performs several tasks:
    - It creates the **Global Execution Context (GEC)**, which includes a **memory space** and an **execution context**.

- The JavaScript engine also creates:
    
    1. **Global Object**:
        - In browsers, this is called `window`.
        - It contains numerous built-in functions and variables accessible from anywhere in the program.
    2. **`this` Keyword**:
        - At the global level, `this` refers to the `window` object.
        - In summary, the engine creates the **GEC**, the **global object** (`window`), and the **`this` variable**.
- Note: The name of the global object differs across environments:
    - In browsers, it is `window`.
    - In Node.js, it is called `global`.
- If a variable is created in the global scope, it gets attached to the global object.
    

**Example:**

```javascript
var x = 10;  
console.log(x);        // 10  
console.log(this.x);   // 10  
console.log(window.x); // 10  
```
