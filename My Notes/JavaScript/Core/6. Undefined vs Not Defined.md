- During the **memory allocation phase**, JavaScript assigns each declared variable a placeholder value: **`undefined`**.
- **`undefined`**: Indicates that memory is allocated for the variable, but no value has been assigned yet.
- **`Not defined`**: Occurs when a variable is not declared (does not exist in memory) and is accessed in the code.

**Key Difference**:

- `Undefined` â‰  `Not defined`

**Examples**:

```javascript
console.log(x); // undefined (memory is allocated but no value yet)  
var x = 25;  
console.log(x); // 25  

console.log(a); // Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined (not declared in memory)  
```

- **JavaScript is loosely typed**: Variables are not bound to any specific datatype. You can assign and reassign values of different types.
    
    ```javascript
    var a = 5;  
    a = true;  
    a = "hello";  
    ```
    
- **Avoid assigning `undefined` manually**: Let JavaScript handle it during memory allocation.
