- Everything in JavaScript happens inside the **execution context**. Think of it as a sealed container where JavaScript runs. It is an abstract concept that holds information about the environment in which the current code is being executed.
    
- The execution context consists of two main components:
    
    1. **Memory Component**:
        - Stores variables and functions in key-value pairs.
        - Also referred to as the **Variable Environment**.
    2. **Code Component**:
        - Executes code line by line.
        - Also known as the **Thread of Execution**.
- JavaScript is a **synchronous** and **single-threaded** language:
    
    - **Synchronous**: Executes commands in a specific order, one after another.
    - **Single-threaded**: Processes one command at a time.
