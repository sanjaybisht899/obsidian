### **What is a Closure?**

A **closure** is a function that **retains access to its lexical scope**, even after the function in which it was declared has finished executing. This means that a closure can access variables from its outer (enclosing) function even when it's called outside that function.

### **Examples**

1. **Basic Closure Example:**
    
    ```js
    function x() {
      var a = 7;
      function y() {
        console.log(a); // Accessing `a` from outer scope
      }
      return y;
    }
    var z = x(); // `z` is a closure containing the function `y` with access to `a`
    z(); // 7
    ```
    
    In this example, `z` is returned from `x` but still has access to `a` even after `x` has completed its execution. This is because the returned function `y` is a **closure** that "remembers" the scope in which it was created.
    
2. **Another Closure Example:**
    
    ```js
    function z() {
      var b = 900;
      function x() {
        var a = 7;
        function y() {
          console.log(a, b); // Accesses both `a` and `b` from outer scopes
        }
        y();
      }
      x();
    }
    z(); // 7 900
    ```
    
    Here, `y` has access to both `a` from `x` and `b` from `z`, demonstrating how closures can "remember" multiple levels of the function scope.
    

### **Closure Definition**

_A closure is a function that has access to its outer function scope even after the function has returned._ This allows the inner function to "remember" and access variables and arguments of its outer function, even when it's called outside that function's scope.

### **Advantages of Closures:**

1. **Module Design Pattern:**
    
    - Using closures, you can encapsulate functionality and avoid polluting the global namespace.
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        const authModule = (function () {
          let loggedInUser = null;
          function login(username) {
            loggedInUser = username;
          }
          function logout() {
            loggedInUser = null;
          }
          return {
            login,
            logout,
            getUserInfo: () => loggedInUser,
          };
        })();
        authModule.login("John");
        console.log(authModule.getUserInfo()); // John
        ```
        
2. **Currying:**
    
    - Currying is a function technique that transforms a function taking multiple arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        const calculateTotalPrice = (taxRate) => (price) => price + price * (taxRate / 100);
        const calculateSalesTax = calculateTotalPrice(8);
        console.log(calculateSalesTax(100)); // 108
        ```
        
3. **Memoization:**
    
    - Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and reuses the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        function fibonacci(n, memo = {}) {
          if (n in memo) return memo[n];
          if (n <= 1) return n;
          memo[n] = fibonacci(n - 1, memo) + fibonacci(n - 2, memo);
          return memo[n];
        }
        console.log(fibonacci(10)); // 55
        ```
        
4. **Data Hiding and Encapsulation:**
    
    - Closures enable private variables and methods, ensuring better data encapsulation and security.
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        class Person {
          #name; // Private field
          constructor(name) {
            this.#name = name;
          }
          getName() {
            return this.#name;
          }
        }
        const person = new Person('Alice');
        console.log(person.getName()); // Alice
        ```
        
5. **`setTimeout` Example:**
    
    - Closures can be used with `setTimeout` to delay execution or schedule code to run later.
    - Example:
        
        ```js
        function showMessage(message, delay) {
          setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(message);
          }, delay);
        }
        showMessage('Hello, world!', 2000); // Message will be logged after 2 seconds
        ```

### **Disadvantages of Closures:**

1. **Overconsumption of Memory:**
    
    - Since closures retain references to their lexical scope, they can lead to memory bloat if too many closures are created, especially in recursive functions or loops.
2. **Memory Leaks:**
    
    - If a closure is not properly garbage collected (because it still holds references to outer variables), it can cause a memory leak, which can eventually slow down your application or even freeze the browser.
3. **Potential Performance Impact:**
    
    - Using closures in certain contexts can have a performance cost, especially when they're deeply nested or invoked frequently. This can impact the performance of applications that require high efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

Closures are a powerful feature in JavaScript that can enhance modularity, optimize code, and support advanced techniques like currying, memoization, and data encapsulation. However, they should be used judiciously to avoid potential memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.
