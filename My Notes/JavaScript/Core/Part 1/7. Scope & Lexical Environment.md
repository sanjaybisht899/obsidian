- **Scope in JavaScript** is closely related to the **Lexical Environment**.

Letâ€™s break it down with examples:

#### **Case 1**

```javascript
function a() {
  console.log(b); // 10
}
var b = 10;
a();
```

- In this case, function `a` can access the variable `b` from the **global scope**, so it prints `10` instead of `undefined`.

#### **Case 2**

```javascript
function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    console.log(b); // 10
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
```

- Here, `c()` is able to access `b` from the global scope, and prints `10`.

#### **Case 3**

```javascript
function a() {
  c();
  function c() {
    var b = 100;
    console.log(b); // 100
  }
}
var b = 10;
a();
```

- In this case, `b` is `100` because the **local variable** `b` inside `c()` takes precedence over the global variable `b`.

#### **Case 4**

```javascript
function a() {
  var b = 10;
  c();
  function c() {
    console.log(b); // 10
  }
}
a();
console.log(b); // Error, Not Defined
```

- The global scope can access `b`, but the global execution context cannot access any local variable (`b` inside `a()`) outside its scope.

### **Execution Context Breakdown:**

- The **call stack** is:  
    `[GEC, a(), c()]`
    
- **Memory sections** in the call stack:
    
    - `c()` = `[lexical environment pointer pointing to a()]`
    - `a()` = `[b:10, c:{}, [lexical environment pointer pointing to GEC]]`
    - `GEC` = `[a:{}, [lexical environment pointer pointing to null]]`

### **Lexical Environment Explanation**:

- **Lexical Environment** = Local memory + Lexical environment of its parent.
- **Lexical** means **hierarchy/order**: When an execution context is created, a **Lexical Environment (LE)** is also created and referenced in the local execution context.

### **Scope Chain / Lexical Environment Chain**:

- The process of going one by one to the parent and checking for variable values is called the **scope chain** or **lexical environment chain**.

Example:

```javascript
function a() {
  function c() {
    // logic here
  }
  c(); // c is lexically inside a
} // a is lexically inside global execution
```

**Lexical (or Static) Scope** refers to the accessibility of variables, functions, and objects based on their physical location in the source code.

```javascript
Global {
    Outer {
        Inner
    }
}
```

- **Inner** is surrounded by the lexical scope of **Outer**.

### **TLDR**:

An inner function can access variables in outer functions, even if deeply nested. However, a function cannot access variables outside its scope.
