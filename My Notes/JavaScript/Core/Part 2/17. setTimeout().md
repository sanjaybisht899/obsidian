## **Trust Issues with `setTimeout()` in JavaScript**

JavaScriptâ€™s `setTimeout()` function does **not guarantee** that the callback will execute **exactly** after the specified delay. Instead, it ensures that the callback **will not be executed before** the delay but might run later due to **call stack congestion**.

### **Example: Why doesnâ€™t `setTimeout(5000)` always run in 5s?**

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
}, 5000);

console.log("End");

// Simulating a heavy computation
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {}  // Takes ~10s to execute
```

### **Expected Output:**

```
Start  
End  
(After ~10s)  
Callback  
```

### **Why does this happen?**

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created and pushed onto the **Call Stack**.
2. `"Start"` is printed.
3. `setTimeout()` registers the callback (`cb()`) in the **Web API environment**, attaches a **5s timer**, and moves on.
4. `"End"` is printed.
5. Meanwhile, the **1 billion loop** blocks the **Call Stack** for **~10 seconds**.
6. In the background, the **5s timer expires**, and `cb()` moves to the **Callback Queue**.
7. The **Event Loop** checks if the **Call Stack** is empty. But since the loop is still running, `cb()` **must wait**.
8. After **10 seconds**, the **Call Stack is free**, and only then is `cb()` executed.

ðŸ”¹ **Key takeaway:** Even though the timer was **5s**, the callback executed **after ~10s** due to the main thread being blocked.

### **`setTimeout(0)`: Does it execute immediately?**

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
```

### **Output:**

```
Start  
End  
Callback  
```

Even with `setTimeout(0)`, the callback **must wait** in the **Callback Queue** until the **Call Stack is empty**. This technique is useful for **deferring** a function execution without blocking the main thread.

---

### **Conclusion:**

- `setTimeout()` **guarantees a minimum delay**, not an exact one.
- The actual execution time depends on the **Call Stack** and **Event Loop**.
- **Avoid blocking the main thread** to ensure timely execution of asynchronous tasks.
