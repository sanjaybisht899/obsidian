### **9. Process for Starting a Kafka Server**

To start a Kafka server, follow these steps:

1. **Start ZooKeeper** (Kafka requires ZooKeeper for managing brokers)
    
    ```sh
    bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
    ```
    
2. **Start Kafka Broker**
    
    ```sh
    bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
    ```
    
3. **Create a Topic** (Optional, for sending messages)
    
    ```sh
    bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
    ```

### **10. When does QueueFullException occur in a Producer?**

**QueueFullException** happens when:

- The producer is sending messages faster than the broker can handle.
- The **buffer.memory** (producer buffer size) is full.
- The broker is experiencing **high load** or **slow disk I/O**.

ðŸ”¹ **Fix:** Increase **buffer.memory** or **batch.size**, and optimize broker performance.

---

### **11. Purpose of Retention Period in Kafka**

The **retention period** defines how long Kafka keeps messages before deleting them.

ðŸ“Œ **Key Points:**

- Controlled by `log.retention.hours` (default **168 hours / 7 days**).
- Helps in managing **storage space**.
- Can be configured **per topic**.

---

### **12. Maximum Size of a Kafka Message**

- The **default max size** of a message is **1MB** (`message.max.bytes`).
- Can be **increased up to 10MB** for larger payloads.
- Larger messages should be **compressed** using Snappy, Gzip, or LZ4.

---

### **13. How to Tune Kafka for Optimal Performance?**

To optimize Kafka performance:

âœ… **Broker Level:**

- Increase **log.segment.bytes** for better throughput.
- Optimize **num.network.threads** and **num.io.threads**.

âœ… **Producer Level:**

- Increase **batch.size** and **linger.ms** to send messages in batches.
- Enable **compression** to reduce network overhead.

âœ… **Consumer Level:**

- Tune **fetch.min.bytes** and **fetch.max.wait.ms** for better polling efficiency.
- Increase **session.timeout.ms** if consumers drop frequently.

âœ… **ZooKeeper Optimization:**

- Use multiple ZooKeeper nodes for high availability.

### **14. Apache Kafka Operations**

- **Creating Topics** â€“ Define a topic with partitions and replication factor.
- **Producing Messages** â€“ Send data from producers to topics.
- **Consuming Messages** â€“ Read data from topics via consumers.
- **Monitoring Kafka** â€“ Track performance, lag, and failures.
- **Managing Partitions** â€“ Balance partitions for load distribution.
- **Scaling Kafka** â€“ Add brokers for increased capacity.

### **15. Types of System Tools in Kafka**

Kafka provides **system tools** for monitoring and managing clusters:

4. **Consumer Offset Checker** â€“ Tracks consumer group offsets.
5. **Replica Verification Tool** â€“ Ensures data consistency.
6. **Topic Management Tool** â€“ Creates, deletes, and modifies topics.
7. **Log Cleaner Tool** â€“ Deletes old messages based on retention policy.

---

### **16. Replication Tools & Their Types**

Kafka replication tools ensure **fault tolerance** by duplicating data.

ðŸ”¹ **Types of Replication Tools:**

8. **Kafka MirrorMaker** â€“ Copies data between Kafka clusters.
9. **Cruise Control** â€“ Automates partition rebalancing.
10. **Geo-Replication** â€“ Syncs Kafka clusters across regions for disaster recovery.

---

### **17. Guarantees Provided by Kafka**

Kafka provides **strong guarantees**:

âœ… **Message Ordering** â€“ Messages are read in the same order they were written within a partition.  
âœ… **At-Least-Once Delivery** â€“ Messages are **not lost**, but may be duplicated.  
âœ… **Exactly-Once Processing (EOS)** â€“ Ensures no duplicates (when configured).  
âœ… **Fault Tolerance** â€“ Data is replicated across multiple brokers.
