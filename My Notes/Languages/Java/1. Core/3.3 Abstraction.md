#### **1. What is Abstraction?**

Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential features to the user.

- It focuses on **what** an object does rather than **how** it does it.
- Helps reduce complexity by breaking down a system into smaller, manageable parts.

#### **Example:**

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound(); // Abstract method with no implementation
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}
```

#### **2. How is Abstraction Different from Encapsulation?**

| **Aspect**         | **Abstraction**                                           | **Encapsulation**                              |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**          | Focuses on hiding **implementation details**.             | Focuses on restricting **access** to the data. |
| **Concept**        | Achieved through **abstract classes** and **interfaces**. | Achieved through **access modifiers**.         |
| **Purpose**        | To show only the essential features of an object.         | To protect the internal state of the object.   |
| **Implementation** | Abstract classes and interfaces.                          | Access modifiers, getters, and setters.        |

#### **3. Abstract Class in Java**

- A class declared with the `abstract` keyword.
- It cannot be instantiated directly.
- Can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) and concrete methods (methods with implementation).

---

#### **4. FAQs on Abstract Classes:**

**Q: Is it allowed to mark a method as abstract without marking the class abstract?**

- No, a method must belong to an abstract class to be declared abstract.

**Q: Is it allowed to mark a method as both abstract and final?**

- No, an abstract method requires overriding, while a `final` method cannot be overridden, making the combination invalid.

**Q: Can we instantiate an abstract class?**

- No, abstract classes cannot be instantiated directly.

#### **5. Interface in Java**

An interface is a blueprint of a class with only abstract methods (until Java 7) and static or default methods (introduced in Java 8).

**Key Features:**

- Methods in interfaces are implicitly `public` and `abstract`.
- Fields in interfaces are `public`, `static`, and `final`.

**Q: Can an interface method be static?**

- Yes, from Java 8 onwards, static methods are allowed in interfaces.

**Q: Why canâ€™t an interface be marked as final?**

- Marking an interface as `final` would prevent it from being implemented, defeating its purpose.

# Difference B/W Abstract & Interface


| Feature                  | **Interface**                                                                | **Abstract Class**                                                                             |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Methods**              | Only abstract methods (Java 7). Can have default & static methods (Java 8+). | Can have both abstract and concrete (implemented) methods.                                     |
| **Variables**            | Only `public static final` (constants).                                      | Can have instance variables, static variables, and constants.                                  |
| **Access Modifiers**     | Methods are always `public` (unless `default` or `static` in Java 8+).       | Can have any access modifier (`private`, `protected`, `public`).                               |
| **Inheritance**          | A class can implement multiple interfaces.                                   | A class can extend only one abstract class.                                                    |
| **Constructors**         | **Not allowed** (Interfaces cannot have constructors).                       | **Allowed** (Can have constructors to initialize instance variables).                          |
| **State Management**     | Cannot maintain state (no instance variables).                               | Can maintain state with instance variables.                                                    |
| **Multiple Inheritance** | Supports multiple inheritance via multiple interfaces.                       | Does not support multiple inheritance.                                                         |
| **Usage**                | Used when multiple classes should follow the same contract (behavior).       | Used when classes share common code but still need some methods to be implemented differently. |
| Object                   | Cannot Create Object                                                         | Cannot Create Object                                                                           |
