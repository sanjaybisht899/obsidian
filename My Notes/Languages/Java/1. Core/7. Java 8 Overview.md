#### **What are the new features released in Java 8?**

Java 8 introduced several significant features to improve productivity, readability, and performance of code. Some of the key features include:

1. **Lambda Expressions**:
    
    - Enables functional programming.
    - Provides a concise way to represent functions or behavior as a method argument.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Hello from Lambda!");
        r.run();
        ```
        
2. **Functional Interfaces**:
    
    - Introduced with the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation.
    - An interface with exactly one abstract method, like `Runnable`, `Comparator`, or custom interfaces.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @FunctionalInterface
        interface Calculator {
            int calculate(int a, int b);
        }
        ```
        
3. **Stream API**:
    
    - Simplifies working with collections and other data sources.
    - Supports functional-style operations like `filter`, `map`, `reduce`.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
        names.stream().filter(name -> name.startsWith("A")).forEach(System.out::println);
        ```
        
4. **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**:
    
    - Interfaces can now have method implementations using the `default` and `static` keywords.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        interface MyInterface {
            default void defaultMethod() {
                System.out.println("Default Method");
            }
            static void staticMethod() {
                System.out.println("Static Method");
            }
        }
        ```
        
5. **Optional Class**:
    
    - A container object to handle `null` values gracefully, avoiding `NullPointerException`.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable("Java");
        name.ifPresent(System.out::println);
        ```
        
6. **Date and Time API**:
    
    - Introduced new `java.time` package for a more powerful and flexible date/time management.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        System.out.println("Today's date: " + date);
        ```
        
7. **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**:
    
    - Replaced Rhino for better performance and integration with JavaScript.
8. **Type Annotations**:
    
    - Expanded support for annotations to apply them to types, not just declarations.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @NonNull String name;
        ```

#### **What are the main benefits of the new features introduced in Java 8?**

The new features in Java 8 provide several key benefits:

1. **Improved Productivity**:
    
    - Lambda expressions and the Stream API simplify complex code, making it more concise and easier to read.
2. **Functional Programming**:
    
    - Allows a declarative approach to problem-solving with less boilerplate code.
3. **Better Date/Time Handling**:
    
    - The `java.time` API eliminates the flaws of the old `Date` and `Calendar` classes.
4. **Enhanced Code Reusability**:
    
    - Default methods in interfaces reduce duplication by allowing method implementations directly in interfaces.
5. **Improved Performance**:
    
    - Stream API optimizes operations using lazy evaluation and parallel processing.
6. **Null Safety**:
    
    - The `Optional` class helps avoid `NullPointerException` and encourages better null handling practices.

#### **Why did Oracle release a new version of Java like Java 8?**

1. **Keeping Up with Modern Programming Trends**:
    
    - Other languages like Scala and Python already embraced functional programming and concise syntax. Java needed to remain competitive.
2. **Addressing Limitations in Previous Versions**:
    
    - Previous versions lacked modern features like lambda expressions, improved date handling, and functional-style processing.
3. **Demand for Parallelism and Performance**:
    
    - With multi-core processors becoming the norm, developers needed tools like the Stream API to leverage parallel computing more efficiently.
4. **Improved Developer Experience**:
    
    - Simplifying common tasks, reducing boilerplate code, and enhancing readability.
5. **Encouraging Best Practices**:
    
    - New features like `Optional` and default methods encourage better design practices and robust code.
