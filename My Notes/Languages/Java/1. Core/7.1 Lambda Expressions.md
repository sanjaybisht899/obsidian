#### **What is a Lambda Expression in Java 8?**

A Lambda Expression is a concise way to represent a method using an expression. It allows you to write code in a functional programming style by passing behavior as a method argument. It eliminates the need for creating anonymous classes to implement functional interfaces.

Example:

```java
// Without Lambda
Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running without Lambda");
    }
};
r1.run();

// With Lambda
Runnable r2 = () -> System.out.println("Running with Lambda");
r2.run();
```

#### **What are the three main parts of a Lambda Expression in Java?**

A Lambda Expression consists of:

1. **Parameter List**:
    - Specifies the input parameters, enclosed in parentheses.
    - Example: `(int a, int b)` or `(a, b)`.
2. **Arrow Token (`->`)**:
    - Separates the parameter list from the method body.
3. **Body**:
    - Defines the logic of the function, which can be a single expression or a block of statements.

Example:

```java
(int a, int b) -> a + b
```

#### **What is the data type of a Lambda Expression?**

The data type of a Lambda Expression is determined by the target type, which is a functional interface. For example, if a Lambda Expression is assigned to a `Runnable`, its type is `Runnable`.

Example:

```java
Runnable r = () -> System.out.println("Lambda Type is Runnable");
```

#### **What is the meaning of the following lambda expression?**

```java
(x, y) -> x + y
```

This Lambda Expression:

- Takes two parameters, `x` and `y`.
- Returns the result of adding `x` and `y`.
- The functional interface for this Lambda could be:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Add {
    int sum(int x, int y);
}
```

#### **What are the advantages of a Lambda Expression?**

1. **Conciseness**:
    - Reduces boilerplate code by removing the need for anonymous classes.
2. **Improved Readability**:
    - Functional code is easier to read and maintain.
3. **Encourages Functional Programming**:
    - Simplifies working with Streams and Collections.
4. **Reusability**:
    - Lambdas enable writing reusable code through functional interfaces.
5. **Parallelism**:
    - Integrates seamlessly with the Stream API to enable parallel processing.

Example:

```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().map(x -> x * x).forEach(System.out::println);
```
