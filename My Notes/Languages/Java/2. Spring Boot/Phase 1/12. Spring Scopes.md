### Understanding Bean Scopes in Spring Boot

In Spring Boot, **scope** refers to the lifecycle and visibility of a bean (an object managed by the Spring container). Different scopes determine how and when a bean is created and shared within the application.

---

### Commonly Used Bean Scopes in Spring Boot:

#### 1. **Singleton** (Default)

- **Description:** A single instance of the bean is created and shared across the entire application.
- **Use Case:** For stateless beans where the same instance can be reused.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    @Component  
    public class SingletonBean {  
        public SingletonBean() {  
            System.out.println("SingletonBean created");  
        }  
    }
    ```
    
    - **Behavior:** Spring creates this bean once, and it is shared throughout the application.

---

#### 2. **Prototype**

- **Description:** A new instance of the bean is created every time it is requested.
- **Use Case:** For stateful beans or when you need a new instance for each use.
- **Configuration:**
    
    ```java
    @Scope("prototype")  
    @Component  
    public class PrototypeBean {  
        public PrototypeBean() {  
            System.out.println("PrototypeBean created");  
        }  
    }
    ```
    
- **Example Usage:**
    
    ```java
    @Autowired  
    private PrototypeBean prototypeBean1;
    
    @Autowired  
    private PrototypeBean prototypeBean2;
    
    // Both `prototypeBean1` and `prototypeBean2` will be different instances.
    ```

#### 3. **Request** (Web Applications)

- **Description:** A new bean instance is created for each HTTP request.
- **Use Case:** For request-specific data, such as storing user session details or request metadata.
- **Configuration:**
    
    ```java
    @Scope("request")  
    @Component  
    public class RequestScopedBean {  
        public RequestScopedBean() {  
            System.out.println("RequestScopedBean created");  
        }  
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 4. **Session** (Web Applications)

- **Description:** A single instance of the bean is created and tied to the lifecycle of an HTTP session.
- **Use Case:** For session-specific data, such as a shopping cart or user preferences.
- **Configuration:**
    
    ```java
    @Scope("session")  
    @Component  
    public class SessionScopedBean {  
        public SessionScopedBean() {  
            System.out.println("SessionScopedBean created");  
        }  
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 5. **Application**

- **Description:** A single instance of the bean is created for the entire lifecycle of the `ServletContext`.
- **Use Case:** For application-wide shared data.
- **Configuration:**
    
    ```java
    @Scope("application")  
    @Component  
    public class ApplicationScopedBean {  
        public ApplicationScopedBean() {  
            System.out.println("ApplicationScopedBean created");  
        }  
    }
    ```
    

---

#### 6. **Custom Scope**

- **Description:** You can define custom scopes if the predefined ones do not meet your requirements.
- **Steps to Implement:**
    - Implement the `Scope` interface.
    - Register your custom scope in the Spring configuration.

---

### Configuring Scope in Spring Boot:

#### Using `@Scope` Annotation

You can define the scope of a bean like this:

```java
@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE) // For prototype scope  
@Component  
public class MyBean {  
    // Bean logic  
}
```

#### Scope with `@Bean`

If you are using the `@Bean` annotation to define beans, you can specify the scope as follows:

```java
@Bean  
@Scope("prototype")  
public MyBean myBean() {  
    return new MyBean();  
}
```

---

### Important Notes:

1. **Default Scope:** The default scope in Spring Boot is **Singleton** unless otherwise specified.
2. **Prototype in Singleton:** Prototype beans injected into a singleton bean need additional handling (e.g., `ObjectFactory` or `Provider`) because Spring does not manage their lifecycle after injection.
3. **Web Scopes:** Web-specific scopes (`request`, `session`) require a **web-aware application context** to function.
