## **🔹 Eureka Server & Service Discovery in Microservices**

Eureka is a **service registry** from Netflix OSS, used for **service discovery** in microservices architecture. It helps microservices dynamically register themselves and discover other services.

---

## **1️⃣ What is a Service Registry?**

A **service registry** is a centralized system that **stores information about all microservices** in an application. Services register themselves and retrieve details of other services from it.

✅ **Example:** Eureka Server

---

## **2️⃣ What is Service Discovery?**

Service Discovery allows microservices to **find and communicate with each other** without hardcoding their locations.

🔹 **Types of Service Discovery:**

- **Client-side discovery** → The client fetches the service location from the registry (e.g., Eureka).
- **Server-side discovery** → The load balancer handles discovery (e.g., AWS ALB, Kubernetes).

---

## **3️⃣ Setting Up Eureka Server**

1️⃣ **Add Eureka Server Dependency** in `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2️⃣ **Enable Eureka Server** in `@SpringBootApplication` class:

```java
@EnableEurekaServer
@SpringBootApplication
public class EurekaServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(EurekaServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

3️⃣ **Configure `application.yml`:**

```yaml
server:
  port: 8761

eureka:
  client:
    register-with-eureka: false  # Since this is a server, it doesn’t register itself
    fetch-registry: false
```

📌 Start the Eureka Server → Visit **[http://localhost:8761/](http://localhost:8761/)** 🎯

---

## **4️⃣ Setting Up Service Registry (Client-Side)**

1️⃣ **Add Eureka Client Dependency in microservices:**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2️⃣ **Enable Eureka Client in Service:**

```java
@EnableEurekaClient
@SpringBootApplication
public class ServiceApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(ServiceApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

3️⃣ **Configure `application.yml`:**

```yaml
spring:
  application:
    name: user-service

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
```

📌 Now, the service registers itself with **Eureka Server**! 🎯

---

## **5️⃣ Setting Up Service Discovery**

**Microservices can discover each other using Spring Cloud LoadBalancer:**  
✅ **Calling another service using `RestTemplate`:**

```java
@LoadBalanced
@Bean
public RestTemplate restTemplate() {
    return new RestTemplate();
}

@Autowired
private RestTemplate restTemplate;

public String getUserDetails() {
    return restTemplate.getForObject("http://user-service/users", String.class);
}
```

📌 The request is sent to **Eureka**, which returns the actual service instance.

---

## **6️⃣ How Eureka Works? (Actions Performed)**

🔹 **Service Registration** → Services register themselves.  
🔹 **Service Heartbeat** → Periodic pings to inform Eureka that they are **alive**.  
🔹 **Service Discovery** → Services fetch available instances.  
🔹 **Instance Removal** → If a service doesn’t send heartbeats, Eureka **removes it** after a timeout.

---

## **7️⃣ `register-with-eureka` vs. `fetch-registry`**

|Property|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`register-with-eureka`|If `true`, registers the service with Eureka Server.|
|`fetch-registry`|If `true`, fetches service information from Eureka.|

📌 **Example:**

- Eureka Server → `register-with-eureka: false`, `fetch-registry: false`
- Microservice Client → `register-with-eureka: true`, `fetch-registry: true`

---

## **8️⃣ How Does Eureka Handle Service Failure?**

- **Self-Preservation Mode:** Eureka **does not immediately remove instances** if it detects failures, preventing mass service failures.
- **Retry Mechanism:** If a service is unavailable, Eureka retries before removing it.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism:** If no heartbeat is received within a threshold, the service is **removed from the registry**.

---

## **9️⃣ Alternatives to Eureka**

🔹 **Consul** → Provides service discovery, health checks, and key-value storage.  
🔹 **Zookeeper** → Distributed service registry with leader election and fault tolerance.  
🔹 **Kubernetes Service Discovery** → Uses DNS-based service discovery.
