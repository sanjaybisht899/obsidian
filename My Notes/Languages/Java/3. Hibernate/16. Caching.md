Caching in Hibernate is used to store data temporarily to reduce the number of database queries, improving performance. There are two main types of caching in Hibernate:

---

### **1. First-Level Cache**

- **Scope**: Per `Session`.
- **Default**: Automatically enabled in Hibernate.
- **Behavior**: Stores objects in memory during a session. Once an object is loaded in the first query, it stays in the session cache until the session is closed. If the same object is accessed again within the same session, it is retrieved from the cache.
- **Example**:
    - A query to load an entity (`Student`) during a session will store that object in memory.
    - On the second access of the same entity within the same session, Hibernate will fetch it from the cache instead of hitting the database again.

**Code Example** (Brief Overview):

```java
Session session = factory.openSession();
Student student = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);  // First query
System.out.println(student.getName() + " " + student.getCity());
Student student2 = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);  // Second query (cache hit)
System.out.println(student2.getName() + " " + student2.getCity());
session.close();
```

- **Output**: It shows that the second query to fetch the same `Student` is faster because it retrieves the object from the cache (in-memory).

---

### **2. Second-Level Cache**

- **Scope**: Per `SessionFactory`.
- **Manual Configuration**: You need to enable it explicitly and configure it.
- **Behavior**: Caches data at the `SessionFactory` level, meaning data is stored and can be accessed across multiple sessions. This allows shared caching between sessions and improves performance for frequently accessed data.
- **Example**:
    - By enabling the second-level cache, the data is stored beyond the lifecycle of a session. If an entity is fetched multiple times across different sessions, Hibernate will use the cached version from the second-level cache.

**Code Example** (Brief Overview):

```java
Session session = factory.openSession();
session.enableCache(Student.class);  // Enabling second-level cache
Student student = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);  // First query
System.out.println(student.getName() + " " + student.getCity());
Student student2 = (Student) session.get(Student.class, 1);  // Second query (cache hit)
System.out.println(student2.getName() + " " + student2.getCity());
session.close();
```

- **Output**: The second query in a different session also benefits from caching (from the `SessionFactory`).

### **Key Differences**:

|**Feature**|**First-Level Cache**|**Second-Level Cache**|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Per `Session`|Per `SessionFactory`|
|**Enabled by Default**|Yes (automatically enabled)|No (needs to be manually enabled)|
|**Caching Duration**|Until session closes|Until evicted or expired (can be manually configured)|
|**Configuration**|Automatically enabled|Requires explicit configuration|
|**Performance Benefit**|Fast access within a session|Shared across sessions, improves performance with long-term use|

---

### **Conclusion**:

- **First-Level Cache** is suitable for session-specific data, where objects are stored temporarily for quick access within a session.
- **Second-Level Cache** is useful when you want to share cached data across multiple sessions, improving database hit performance over time.


# Questions

#### **13. What is the First-Level Cache in Hibernate?**

The **First-Level Cache** is a built-in caching mechanism in Hibernate that is associated with the Hibernate **Session** object.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - It is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
    - Caches objects within the same session scope.
    - Any query or operation executed within the same session first checks the cache before interacting with the database.
- **Example:**
    
    ```java
    Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
    
    // First time fetches from database and stores in cache
    Employee emp1 = session.get(Employee.class, 1);
    
    // Second time fetches from the cache, no database query executed
    Employee emp2 = session.get(Employee.class, 1);
    ```

#### **14. What Are the Different Second-Level Caches Available in Hibernate?**

The **Second-Level Cache** is an optional, session-independent cache that stores data at the **SessionFactory** level.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - Shared across multiple sessions.
    - It must be explicitly enabled in the configuration.
- **Popular Second-Level Cache Providers:**
    
    1. **EHCache:** A commonly used open-source caching solution.
    2. **Infinispan:** A distributed in-memory data grid.
    3. **OSCache:** Supports caching for web applications.
    4. **Apache Ignite:** Supports distributed caching.
    5. **Memcached or Redis (with custom integration):** For high-performance distributed caching.

---

#### **15. How Can We Disable the Second-Level Cache in Hibernate?**

You can disable the second-level cache in Hibernate by modifying the configuration file or annotations.

- **Steps to Disable:**
    
    1. Ensure that the second-level cache is not enabled in the Hibernate configuration.
    2. Remove the cache provider from the dependencies.
    3. Avoid using caching annotations like `@Cache`.
- **Example Configuration:**
    
    ```xml
    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache">false</property>
    ```
    

---

#### **16. What is Query Cache in Hibernate?**

The **Query Cache** is an optional caching mechanism in Hibernate that stores the results of queries, not the entities themselves.

- **Key Characteristics:**
    
    - Depends on the second-level cache being enabled.
    - Useful for caching the result of complex queries.
    - Must be explicitly enabled and used in the query.
- **Enabling Query Cache:**
    
    ```xml
    <property name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache">true</property>
    ```
    
- **Using Query Cache in Code:**
    
    ```java
    Query query = session.createQuery("FROM Employee WHERE department = :dept");
    query.setParameter("dept", "HR");
    query.setCacheable(true); // Enable query cache
    List<Employee> employees = query.list();
    ```

#### **17. What Are the Different Strategies for Cache Mapping in Hibernate?**

Hibernate provides several strategies to map caching for entities and collections:

1. **Read-Only:**
    
    - Suitable for data that doesnâ€™t change.
    - Example: Reference tables like `Country`, `State`, etc.
    
    ```java
    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_ONLY)
    ```
    
2. **Read-Write:**
    
    - Allows updates, ensuring strong consistency.
    - Suitable for entities that are frequently read and occasionally updated.
    - Hibernate uses versioning to manage concurrency.
    
    ```java
    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.READ_WRITE)
    ```
    
3. **Non-Strict Read-Write:**
    
    - Provides less consistency but better performance.
    - Suitable when occasional stale data is acceptable.
    
    ```java
    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE)
    ```
    
4. **Transactional:**
    
    - Fully synchronized with the database transaction.
    - Suitable for applications requiring high consistency.
    - Requires JTA transactions.
    
    ```java
    @Cache(usage = CacheConcurrencyStrategy.TRANSACTIONAL)
    ```
    
5. **No Caching:**
    
    - Use when no caching is required.
    - By default, caching is disabled for entities without specific annotations.
