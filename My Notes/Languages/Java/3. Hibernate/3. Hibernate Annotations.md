1. **`@Entity`**
    
    - Marks a class as an entity (i.e., a database table).
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Entity
        public class Student {
        }
        ```
        
2. **`@Table`**
    
    - Allows customization of the table name and other table details.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Entity
        @Table(name = "student_table")
        public class Student {
        }
        ```
        
3. **`@Id`**
    
    - Marks a field as the primary key.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Id
        private int id;
        ```
        
4. **`@GeneratedValue`**
    
    - Indicates that Hibernate should generate values for the primary key automatically (e.g., using an internal sequence).
    - Useful for auto-incremented columns.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Id
        @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
        private int id;
        ```
        
5. **`@Column`**
    
    - Used to specify column properties, such as name, nullability, length, etc.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Column(name = "student_name", nullable = false, length = 100)
        private String name;
        ```
        
6. **`@Transient`**
    
    - Marks a field to be ignored by Hibernate (not persisted in the database).
    - Use this when you have a variable in your class that shouldn't be saved to the database.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Transient
        private int tempData;
        ```
        
7. **`@Temporal`**
    
    - Used to specify the format of date and time fields when saving to the database.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Temporal(TemporalType.DATE)
        private Date birthDate;
        ```
        
8. **`@Lob`**
    
    - Indicates that a field is a large object (e.g., BLOB for binary data or CLOB for character data).
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @Lob
        private byte[] profilePicture;
        ```
        
9. **`@OneToOne`**
    
    - Defines a one-to-one relationship between two entities.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @OneToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
        private Address address;
        ```
        
10. **`@OneToMany`**
    
    - Defines a one-to-many relationship between two entities.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @OneToMany(mappedBy = "student", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
        private List<Subject> subjects;
        ```
        
11. **`@ManyToOne`**
    
    - Defines a many-to-one relationship between two entities.
    - Example:
        
        ```java
        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "class_id")
        private Class classEntity;
        ```
        
12. **`@JoinColumn`**
    
    - Used to customize the foreign key column for relationships.
    - Example:
        
        ```copy
        @OneToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "address_id")
        private Address address;
        ```
