Decomposition is about breaking a **monolithic application** into **smaller microservices**, making it **scalable, maintainable, and independent**. However, if done incorrectly, it can lead to **tight coupling, data inconsistency, and performance bottlenecks**.

Below are the key decomposition patterns used in microservices:

---

## **1. Decomposition by Business Capability**

Each microservice corresponds to a **specific business function** or capability.

### âœ… **When to Use?**

- Your application has **clear business domains** (e.g., Order Management, Payments, Inventory).
- Each capability can function **independently** and has its **own data**.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example**

A **Food Delivery App** might have:

- **Order Service** â€“ Handles order placement.
- **Payment Service** â€“ Processes payments.
- **Delivery Service** â€“ Manages rider allocation and tracking.

ðŸ’¡ **Why is this useful?**

- If the **Payment Service** fails, the **Order Service** still works.
- Each service can **scale independently** (e.g., Payment Service handles heavy load separately).

---

## **2. Decomposition by Subdomains (Domain-Driven Design - DDD)**

Microservices are built based on **bounded contexts** within a business domain.

### âœ… **When to Use?**

- When your application has **multiple complex business areas** with **shared concepts**.
- To **avoid tight coupling** between microservices.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example: E-commerce Platform**

A large e-commerce system has multiple subdomains:

- **Catalog Subdomain** â†’ Manages products, categories.
- **Ordering Subdomain** â†’ Handles order creation and checkout.
- **Shipping Subdomain** â†’ Deals with delivery and logistics.

ðŸ’¡ **Why is this useful?**

- **Different teams** can work on different subdomains.
- **Database models** remain independent for each subdomain.

---

## **3. Decomposition by Technical Layers**

Some applications are broken down based on **technical concerns**, such as API, business logic, and data access layers.

### âœ… **When to Use?**

- If you want **high reusability** of common services.
- If your application follows **strict layered architecture**.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example: Banking Application**

- **API Gateway** â€“ Handles client requests.
- **Auth Service** â€“ Manages authentication (OAuth, JWT).
- **Transaction Service** â€“ Processes money transfers.

ðŸ’¡ **Why is this useful?**

- **Security** and **authentication** logic is centralized.
- Business logic is **separate from infrastructure code**.

---

## **4. Decomposition by Scalability Requirements**

Microservices are designed based on **which components need to scale independently**.

### âœ… **When to Use?**

- When some parts of the system experience **more traffic** than others.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example: Video Streaming Service (Netflix, YouTube)**

- **Video Processing Service** â€“ Needs **high computing power** (FFmpeg encoding).
- **User Profile Service** â€“ Handles **moderate traffic**.
- **Recommendation Service** â€“ Requires **AI/ML processing**.

ðŸ’¡ **Why is this useful?**

- You donâ€™t need to **scale the entire system**, only **high-load** services.

---

## **5. Strangler Fig Pattern (Incremental Migration from Monolith to Microservices)**

Instead of breaking everything at once, **gradually replace** monolithic features with microservices.

### âœ… **When to Use?**

- If you **canâ€™t afford downtime** while migrating.
- If you want a **risk-free transition** from monolith to microservices.

### ðŸ“Œ **Example: Banking System Migration**

1. Move **User Authentication** to a microservice.
2. Migrate **Transaction Processing** next.
3. Eventually, decompose the entire monolithic system.

ðŸ’¡ **Why is this useful?**

- Old monolith continues to work while microservices **gradually take over**.
- Less **risk** compared to a **big-bang migration**.

## **Best Practices for Decomposition**

âœ… **Keep services loosely coupled** â€“ One microservice should **not depend** too much on another.  
âœ… **Define clear boundaries** â€“ Use **DDD (Domain-Driven Design)** for better separation.  
âœ… **Avoid too many small microservices** â€“ Over-decomposition can lead to **performance overhead**.  
âœ… **Ensure independent data management** â€“ Use **Database per Service** pattern to avoid conflicts.  
âœ… **Use API Gateway** â€“ To manage communication between microservices efficiently.
