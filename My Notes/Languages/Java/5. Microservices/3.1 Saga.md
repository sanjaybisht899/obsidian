In a **monolithic application**, transactions are managed by a single database using **ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)** properties. However, in a **microservices architecture**, each service has its own database, making **distributed transactions** challenging. The **Saga pattern** ensures data consistency **without using a distributed transaction manager**.

---

## **🛠 How Saga Works?**

A **business transaction** is split into a series of **local transactions**, where each service **executes a step** and publishes an event for the next service. If a step **fails**, a **compensating transaction** is triggered to undo the previous steps.

---

## **📝 When to Use the Saga Pattern?**

✅ When a **single business operation spans multiple microservices**.  
✅ When **eventual consistency** is acceptable.  
✅ When a **global transaction lock is not feasible** (e.g., NoSQL, sharded databases).

## **📌 Example: E-commerce Order Processing (Saga Flow)**

### **Happy Path (Success)**

1️⃣ **Order Service** creates an order → **Event: `OrderCreated`**  
2️⃣ **Payment Service** processes the payment → **Event: `PaymentSuccess`**  
3️⃣ **Inventory Service** updates stock → **Event: `StockUpdated`**  
4️⃣ **Order Service** marks order as **confirmed**

### **Failure Scenario**

If **payment fails**, a **compensating action** is triggered:  
❌ **Payment Service fails** → **Event: `PaymentFailed`**  
🔄 **Order Service** cancels the order → **Event: `OrderCancelled`**

This rollback ensures that the system remains **consistent**.

## **🔄 Types of Saga Patterns**

There are **two main approaches** for implementing the Saga pattern:

| Saga Type                       | Description                                                                             | When to Use?                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Choreography-based Saga**  | Services communicate **directly** via **events**. No central controller.                | **Best for fewer microservices** with **simple workflows**.                 |
| **2. Orchestration-based Saga** | A **Saga Coordinator (Orchestrator)** manages the entire workflow by invoking services. | **Best for complex workflows** where services need **centralized control**. |

---

## **1️⃣ Choreography-based Saga (Event-Driven)**

Each service **listens for events** and **reacts accordingly** without a central controller.

### **✔ Advantages**

- **Loosely coupled** (each service acts independently).
- **Better scalability** (no single bottleneck).

### **❌ Challenges**

- Hard to track & debug event flows.
- **Compensating actions must be carefully handled**.

### **📌 Example (Order Processing - Event Flow)**

- `OrderCreated` → Payment Service listens → `PaymentSuccess` → Inventory Service listens → `StockUpdated`
- If `PaymentFailed` → Order Service **listens** and **cancels order**.

---

## **2️⃣ Orchestration-based Saga (Centralized)**

A **Saga Orchestrator** manages the workflow by invoking services **explicitly**.

### **✔ Advantages**

- **Centralized error handling** and **compensating actions**.
- **Easier to debug and manage** complex workflows.

### **❌ Challenges**

- **Tightly coupled** (all services depend on the orchestrator).
- Single point of failure if orchestrator crashes.

### **📌 Example (Order Processing - Orchestrated Flow)**

1. **Order Service** calls **Orchestrator** to create an order.
2. **Orchestrator** calls **Payment Service** → Payment succeeds.
3. **Orchestrator** calls **Inventory Service** → Stock updated.
4. **Orchestrator** confirms the order.

If payment fails, the **Orchestrator** initiates a rollback (e.g., cancel order).

---

## **💡 Key Takeaways**

- **Choreography** → **Event-driven**, best for **simple workflows**.
- **Orchestration** → **Centralized**, best for **complex workflows**.
- **Saga ensures eventual consistency** in distributed transactions.
