### Hoisting in JavaScript (Variables & Functions)

Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the **memory creation phase** of the execution context. This allows us to access variables and functions even before they are declared in the code.

---

### Example 1: Hoisting with Variables and Functions
```javascript
getName(); // Output: "Namaste Javascript"
console.log(x); // Output: undefined
var x = 7;
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste Javascript");
}
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Memory Creation Phase**:
   - `x` is allocated memory and initialized with `undefined`.
   - The entire `getName` function is stored in memory.
2. **Code Execution Phase**:
   - When `getName()` is called, the function is already in memory, so it executes successfully.
   - `console.log(x)` prints `undefined` because `x` is initialized but not yet assigned a value.
   - `x` is later assigned the value `7`.

---

### Key Points:
- Hoisting allows accessing variables and functions before their declaration.
- Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`.
- Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning the entire function is stored in memory.

---

### Example 2: Hoisting with Function Expressions
```javascript
getName(); // Uncaught TypeError: getName is not a function
console.log(getName); // Output: undefined
var getName = function () {
  console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
};
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Memory Creation Phase**:
   - `getName` is allocated memory and initialized with `undefined` (since it’s a variable, not a function declaration).
2. **Code Execution Phase**:
   - When `getName()` is called, `getName` is still `undefined`, leading to a `TypeError`.
   - `console.log(getName)` prints `undefined` because the function expression has not yet been assigned to `getName`.

---

### Key Differences:
- **Function Declarations**: Fully hoisted (entire function is stored in memory).
- **Function Expressions**: Treated like variables, hoisted but initialized with `undefined`.

---

### Example 3: No Hoisting with Undeclared Variables
```javascript
getName(); // Output: "Namaste JavaScript"
console.log(x); // Uncaught ReferenceError: x is not defined
console.log(getName); // Output: ƒ getName() { console.log("Namaste JavaScript"); }
function getName() {
  console.log("Namaste JavaScript");
}
```

#### Explanation:
- `x` is not declared, so accessing it throws a `ReferenceError`.
- `getName` is a function declaration, so it is fully hoisted and can be accessed before its declaration.

---

### Summary:
- **Variables**: Hoisted but initialized with `undefined`.
- **Function Declarations**: Fully hoisted (entire function is stored in memory).
- **Function Expressions**: Hoisted as variables, initialized with `undefined`.
- **Undeclared Variables**: Not hoisted, throws a `ReferenceError`.

# Questions

* Functional Expression vs Function Declaration

| **Aspect**     | **Function Declaration**                      | **Function Expression**                          |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition** | Defines a named function.                     | Defines a function and assigns it to a variable. |
| **Syntax**     | `function funcName() {}`                      | `const funcName = function() {};`                |
| **Hoisting**   | Fully hoisted (available before declaration). | Not hoisted (accessible only after declaration). |
| **Name**       | Requires a name.                              | Can be anonymous or named.                       |
| **Use Case**   | Best for reusable, named functions.           | Useful for dynamic or anonymous functions.       |
