### Functions and Variable Environments

In JavaScript, each function call creates a new **local execution context** with its own variable environment. This allows variables with the same name to exist independently in different scopes.

---

### Example Code:
```javascript
var x = 1;
a();
b(); // Functions are called before defining them. This works due to hoisting.
console.log(x);

function a() {
  var x = 10; // Local scope due to separate execution context
  console.log(x);
}

function b() {
  var x = 100;
  console.log(x);
}
```

#### Output:
```
10
100
1
```

### Code Flow in Terms of Execution Context

1. **Global Execution Context (GEC)** is created and pushed into the **Call Stack**.
   - **Call Stack**: `[GEC]`

2. **Memory Creation Phase**:
   - Variables and functions are allocated memory.
     - `x` is initialized with `undefined`.
     - Functions `a` and `b` are stored with their entire code.

3. **Code Execution Phase**:
   - `x` is assigned the value `1` in the GEC.
   - `a()` is called:
     - A new **local execution context** for `a` is created and pushed into the Call Stack.
     - **Call Stack**: `[GEC, a()]`
     - In the local context of `a`:
       - A new variable `x` is created and assigned `10`.
       - `console.log(x)` prints `10`.
     - After execution, the local context for `a` is removed from the Call Stack.
     - **Call Stack**: `[GEC]`
   - `b()` is called:
     - A new **local execution context** for `b` is created and pushed into the Call Stack.
     - **Call Stack**: `[GEC, b()]`
     - In the local context of `b`:
       - A new variable `x` is created and assigned `100`.
       - `console.log(x)` prints `100`.
     - After execution, the local context for `b` is removed from the Call Stack.
     - **Call Stack**: `[GEC]`
   - Finally, `console.log(x)` in the GEC prints `1` (the value of `x` in the global scope).

4. **Program Ends**:
   - The GEC is deleted and removed from the Call Stack.

---

### Key Points:
- Each function call creates a new **local execution context** with its own variable environment.
- Variables with the same name can exist independently in different scopes.
- The **Call Stack** keeps track of the order of execution contexts.
- After a function completes execution, its local context is removed from the Call Stack.
