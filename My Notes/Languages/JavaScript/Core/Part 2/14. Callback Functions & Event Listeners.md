#### **Callback Functions**

In JavaScript, **functions are first-class citizens**, meaning you can **pass functions as arguments** to other functions. This is known as a **callback function**.

A **callback function** gives us access to the **asynchronous world** while still operating in the **synchronous** world. When you pass a function to another function, the receiving function has the option to call it when the time is right. This mechanism allows JavaScript to perform **asynchronous operations** even though itâ€™s single-threaded.

#### **Example: Using `setTimeout` with a Callback**

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Timer");
}, 1000);  // First argument is callback function, second is the timer.
```

- JavaScript is **single-threaded** and **synchronous**, but `setTimeout` lets us perform asynchronous operations by executing code after a delay.
- The function inside `setTimeout` will be executed after 1000ms, but the main thread doesnâ€™t wait; it proceeds to the next lines of code.

#### **Another Example: Callback with Functions**

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("Timer");
}, 5000);

function x(y) {
  console.log("x");
  y();
}

x(function y() {
  console.log("y");
});
```

**Expected Output:**

```
x
y
Timer
```

- In this case, `x` is a function that accepts another function `y` (a callback) as its argument. When `x` is called, it logs `"x"`, then immediately calls `y()` and logs `"y"`.
- The **`setTimeout`** callback is executed after 5000ms, logging `"Timer"`.

#### **Key Point:**

- All three functions (x, y, setTimeout) are executed in the **call stack**. Once executed, they are removed, and the timerâ€™s callback function will eventually be placed into the call stack after the specified delay.
- **Blocking the main thread**: If any operation takes a long time (like a 30-second function), it **blocks the main thread**, causing delays in the execution of other tasks. To avoid this, always use **asynchronous operations** (e.g., `setTimeout` for delays).

#### **Callback Chain Example**

To perform multiple asynchronous tasks in sequence, you can **chain callbacks**:

```javascript
function printStr(str, cb) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(str);
    cb();
  }, Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1);
}

function printAll() {
  printStr("A", () => {
    printStr("B", () => {
      printStr("C", () => {});
    });
  });
}

printAll();  // Output: A B C (in order)
```

- In this example, we print `"A"`, `"B"`, and `"C"` in order, even though `setTimeout` is asynchronous. Each callback is executed only after the previous one completes, ensuring that the output follows the expected sequence.

### **Event Listeners & Closures**

#### **What is an Event Listener?**

An **event listener** is a function that waits for a specific event to occur on a DOM element (like a button click, mouse hover, etc.). Once the event occurs, the callback function is executed.

#### **Example: Adding a Click Event Listener**

```html
<button id="clickMe">Click Me!</button>
```

```javascript

document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function xyz() {
  console.log("Button clicked");
});
```

- When the button is clicked, the **callback function (`xyz`)** is called and logs `"Button clicked"`.

#### **Implementing a Counter Button with Event Listener**

Here, a counter increments every time the button is clicked:

```javascript
let count = 0;
document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function xyz() {
  console.log("Button clicked", ++count);
});
```

- **Note**: Using a **global variable** like `count` isnâ€™t ideal because it can be modified from anywhere, leading to potential bugs.

#### **Using Closures for Data Abstraction**

To avoid global variables and encapsulate the data (like the `count`), use **closures**:

```javascript
function attachEventList() {
  let count = 0;
  document.getElementById("clickMe").addEventListener("click", function xyz() {
    console.log("Button clicked", ++count);  // `xyz` forms a closure with outer scope `count`
  });
}

attachEventList();  // The counter is now encapsulated within the closure.
```

- Here, the event listener has access to the `count` variable through the closure, keeping the variable private and safe from external changes.

### **Event Listener Performance Considerations**

#### **Garbage Collection & Removing Event Listeners**

Event listeners can have performance implications. Since they form **closures**, they hold onto data (like the `count` variable) even after the event listener is removed. This can cause **memory leaks** if event listeners are not properly cleaned up.

- **Removing event listeners** when they are no longer needed helps in **garbage collection** and frees up memory:

```javascript
const button = document.getElementById("clickMe");

function handleClick() {
  console.log("Button clicked");
}

// Adding event listener
button.addEventListener("click", handleClick);

// Removing event listener
button.removeEventListener("click", handleClick);
```

- If you donâ€™t remove unused event listeners, it can cause memory issues, especially on pages with a lot of elements (like `onClick`, `onHover`, or `onScroll` events).

---

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Callback functions** allow asynchronous operations to run while JavaScript remains synchronous.
- **Event listeners** are used to wait for specific events and trigger actions (callbacks).
- **Closures** help manage variables in event listeners by encapsulating data and preventing accidental access or modification.
- Always **remove event listeners** when not needed to avoid memory leaks and improve performance.
