1. **JavaScript Engine**: The browser has a JavaScript engine that runs the code you write. Inside this engine, there is a **call stack** that keeps track of the functions that need to be executed.
    
2. **Call Stack**:
    
    - The **call stack** is where JavaScript keeps track of what it needs to do. When a function is called, it is added to the stack. Once the function is done, it is removed from the stack.
    - The **global execution context (GEC)** is the initial context where your JavaScript code runs. It’s the starting point.
3. **Web APIs**:
    
    - **Web APIs** are extra features that the browser gives to JavaScript (like timers, DOM access, fetching data from a server, etc.), but these are **not** part of JavaScript. These features are provided by the browser.
    - Examples of Web APIs are:
        - **setTimeout()** – to run code after a delay.
        - **DOM APIs** – for interacting with HTML elements (e.g., `document.getElementById()`).
        - **fetch()** – to make network requests.
        - **localStorage** – for storing data in the browser.
4. **Event Loop**:
    
    - The **event loop** is the mechanism that makes JavaScript asynchronous. It constantly checks if the **call stack** is empty and then checks the **callback queue** (where functions like `setTimeout()` wait).
    - The event loop looks for tasks in the **callback queue** and moves them to the **call stack** when the stack is empty.

### Step-by-Step Example:

#### Code 1:

```javascript
console.log("start");
setTimeout(function cb() {
  console.log("timer");
}, 5000);
console.log("end");
```

1. First, JavaScript logs `"start"`.
2. Then, `setTimeout()` is called, which is a Web API. It starts the timer but doesn’t immediately add the function `cb` to the call stack.
3. `"end"` is logged next.
4. After 5 seconds, the `cb()` function is ready to be executed. It doesn’t go directly into the call stack but goes into the **callback queue**.
5. The **event loop** keeps checking if the call stack is empty. Once it is, the event loop moves `cb()` from the **callback queue** to the **call stack**, and it logs `"timer"`.

#### Key Idea:

- The **callback queue** holds functions that are waiting to be executed (like the `cb()` function).
- The **event loop** checks the callback queue and moves functions to the call stack when it’s empty.

#### Code 2 (EventListener Example):

```javascript
console.log("Start");
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", function cb() {
  console.log("Callback");
});
console.log("End");
```

1. `"Start"` is logged first.
2. The `addEventListener()` is used to listen for a button click. This is a **Web API**, and it stays in the browser environment.
3. `"End"` is logged.
4. The `cb()` function waits in the **Web API environment** until the user clicks the button.
5. When the user clicks the button, `cb()` goes into the **callback queue**, and the **event loop** moves it to the call stack to be executed.

### Fetch and Microtask Queue:

Let’s consider this example:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(function cbT() {
  console.log("CB Timeout");
}, 5000);

fetch("https://api.netflix.com").then(function cbF() {
  console.log("CB Netflix");
});

console.log("End");
```

1. `"Start"` is logged first.
2. `setTimeout()` starts a timer (waiting for 5 seconds) and goes into the **callback queue**.
3. `fetch()` starts an asynchronous request to get data (it will take 2 seconds). When the data is fetched, its callback (`cbF()`) goes into a special queue called the **microtask queue**.
4. `"End"` is logged.
5. The event loop first checks the **microtask queue** (since it has higher priority than the callback queue) and runs the `cbF()` function (logging `"CB Netflix"`).
6. After that, it checks the **callback queue** and runs the `cbT()` function (logging `"CB Timeout"`).

### Why Microtask Queue Exists:

- The **microtask queue** has higher priority than the **callback queue**.
- Functions from **promises** (like `then()`) and **mutation observers** go into the **microtask queue**.
- **Microtasks** are always executed before **callback tasks** (like `setTimeout()`).

### Common Questions:

- **When does the event loop start?**
    - The event loop runs continuously in the background. It checks the call stack and the queues to process tasks.
- **Why doesn't `setTimeout()` with 0ms wait for the call stack to be empty?**
    - Even if you set a timeout of 0ms, the callback still needs to wait until the call stack is empty. This is because JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can only execute one thing at a time.

### Summary:

- The **call stack** is where functions are executed.
- **Web APIs** give JavaScript extra capabilities.
- The **event loop** manages the callback queue and the call stack, ensuring that asynchronous code gets executed after the current tasks are completed.
- **Microtasks** (like promises) have higher priority than tasks in the callback queue.
