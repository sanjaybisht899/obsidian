This is a detailed breakdown of how JavaScript engines work, particularly focusing on Google's V8 engine. Let me explain this in simpler terms for you:

### 1. **JavaScript Runtime Environment (JRE):**

- **JRE** is a container that holds everything necessary to run JavaScript code. Think of it as the environment where JavaScript code is executed.
- It contains:
    - **JS Engine** (The heart of JRE)
    - **APIs** that help JS interact with the outside world (like the DOM in browsers)
    - **Event Loop, Callback Queue, and Microtask Queue**, which manage tasks like events and asynchronous functions.

This is why **browsers** and other devices (like smartwatches and robots) can execute JavaScript code â€” they all have a JRE built into them.

### 2. **JavaScript Engines:**

- **ECMAScript** is the official standard governing JavaScript, which ensures that all JavaScript engines (like **V8 (Chrome)**, **Chakra (Edge)**, **SpiderMonkey (Firefox)**) follow the same basic rules.
- **JavaScript Engine** is not a physical machine, but a software (often written in low-level languages like C++) that takes JavaScript code (high-level) and converts it into machine code (low-level) so it can be executed by the computer.

### 3. **The 3 Main Steps Inside a JavaScript Engine:**

- **Parsing**: The code you write (like `let a = 7`) is broken into smaller pieces called **tokens** (`let`, `a`, `=`, `7`). Then, the code is converted into a structure called an **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**, which is essentially a JSON representation of your code.
- **Compilation**: JavaScript engines use **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**. This means the code is both interpreted (line-by-line) and compiled (optimized and converted into machine code). In modern JS engines, both tasks happen simultaneously.
    - The **AST** is passed through an **interpreter** (to get byte code) while the **compiler** optimizes the code during execution.
- **Execution**: The engine executes the code using:
    - **Memory Heap**: Where data is stored.
    - **Call Stack**: Keeps track of function calls.
    - **Garbage Collector**: Removes unnecessary data from memory (using a method called **Mark and Sweep**).

### 4. **V8 Engine:**

- Google's **V8** engine is one of the most well-known JavaScript engines and is used in **Chrome** and **Node.js**.
- V8 has the following parts:
    - **Interpreter (Ignition)**: This reads and executes JavaScript code.
    - **Compiler (TurboFan)**: Optimizes the code to make it run faster.
    - **Garbage Collector (Orinoco)**: Manages memory and removes unused data.

### Summary:

- JavaScript engines convert your high-level JS code into machine code using **parsing**, **compilation**, and **execution**.
- Modern JS engines use **JIT compilation** to make the execution faster and more efficient.
- **V8** is a powerful engine used by Chrome and Node.js, with components like **Ignition**, **TurboFan**, and **Orinoco** to handle different tasks.
