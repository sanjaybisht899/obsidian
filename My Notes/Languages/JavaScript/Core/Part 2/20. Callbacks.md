### **What is a Callback?**

A **callback** is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later. Callbacks are crucial for handling **asynchronous operations** in JavaScript.

## **Two Aspects of Callbacks**

1. **Good Part** ‚Üí Callbacks are essential for handling asynchronous code.
2. **Bad Part** ‚Üí Callbacks can lead to issues like:
    - **Callback Hell**
    - **Inversion of Control**

Understanding the drawbacks of callbacks is crucial for learning **Promises** and **async/await**.

## **JavaScript is Synchronous & Single-Threaded**

JavaScript executes code **line by line** in a single thread (one operation at a time). It does not wait for long-running tasks by default.

```js
console.log("Namaste");
console.log("JavaScript");
console.log("Season 2");
```

### **Output:**

```
Namaste
JavaScript
Season 2
```

- JavaScript quickly executes all instructions because **"Time, tide & JavaScript waits for none."**

---

## **Introducing Callbacks in Asynchronous Code**

What if we want to **delay execution**? We can use callbacks with functions like `setTimeout`.

```js
console.log("Namaste");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("JavaScript");
}, 5000);

console.log("Season 2");
```

### **Output (after 5 seconds delay):**

```
Namaste
Season 2
JavaScript
```

- Here, `setTimeout` **delays execution** using a callback function.

## **Callback in Real-World (E-Commerce Scenario)**

Imagine an **e-commerce application** where a user places an order. The backend process involves:

1. Creating an Order
2. Proceeding to Payment

### **Without Callbacks (Wrong Approach)**

```js
const cart = ["shoes", "pants", "kurta"];

api.createOrder();
api.proceedToPayment();
```

- ‚ùå **Problem:** `proceedToPayment()` might execute **before** the order is created.

### **With Callbacks (Correct Approach)**

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment();
});
```

- ‚úÖ Here, `createOrder()` ensures that **order creation completes first** before calling `proceedToPayment()`.

---

## **Callback Hell (Pyramid of Doom)**

What if after payment, we need to:

- Show the **Order Summary**
- **Update Wallet Balance**

### **Nested Callbacks (Problematic Code)**

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment(function () {
    api.showOrderSummary(function () {
      api.updateWallet();
    });
  });
});
```

- ‚ùå This structure is **hard to read & maintain**.
- ‚ùå When multiple callbacks are nested, it leads to **Callback Hell** (also called the **Pyramid of Doom**).

---

## **Inversion of Control**

Another problem with callbacks is **loss of control over execution**.

### **Example of Inversion of Control**

```js
api.createOrder(cart, function () {
  api.proceedToPayment();
});
```

- ‚ùå We are **blindly trusting** `createOrder()` to call `proceedToPayment()`.
- ‚ùå If `createOrder()` is written by another developer, what if:
    - It **forgets** to call `proceedToPayment()`?
    - It **calls it multiple times**?
    - It **never calls it at all**?

üí° **Inversion of Control:** We lose control over the execution flow when we pass a callback.

---

## **Why Learn Promises?**

- **Async programming in JavaScript exists because callbacks have limitations.**
- Promises help solve **Callback Hell** and **Inversion of Control** issues.

### **Next Steps:** Learn **Promises** and **async/await** to fix these issues!
