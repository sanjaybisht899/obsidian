### **Difference Between Multicore and Multithreading in OS**

|Feature|**Multicore** üñ•Ô∏è|**Multithreading** üßµ|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|Multiple CPU cores in a single processor.|Multiple threads running within a single process.|
|**Hardware/Software**|Hardware-based (physical cores).|Software-based (virtual threads).|
|**Parallelism**|True parallel execution (each core executes independently).|Simulated parallelism (threads share CPU time).|
|**Performance**|Higher performance as each core executes independently.|Increases efficiency by switching between threads.|
|**Example**|Quad-core, Octa-core processors.|Java‚Äôs `Thread` class, OS-level multithreading.|
|**Use Case**|Running multiple programs simultaneously (e.g., running a browser & video editor at once).|Running multiple tasks within a program (e.g., a browser handling UI and downloads simultaneously).|

### **Key Takeaway:**

- **Multicore = Multiple processors executing in true parallelism.**
- **Multithreading = One processor switching between multiple tasks quickly.**
