### **3. Redux vs Context API (State Management)**

Both are used for state management in React but serve different purposes.

| Feature         | Redux                                  | Context API                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Centralized state management           | Prop-drilling alternative        |
| **Best For**    | Large-scale apps with complex state    | Small-to-medium apps             |
| **Data Flow**   | Strict unidirectional                  | More flexible                    |
| **Performance** | Uses reducers for predictable updates  | Can cause unnecessary re-renders |
| **Ease of Use** | Requires setup with reducers & actions | Simple and built-in              |
