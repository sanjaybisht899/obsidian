### **1. What is Apache Kafka?**

Apache Kafka is an **open-source distributed event streaming platform** used for **real-time data processing**. It works as a **message broker** that allows applications to publish, subscribe, store, and process streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.

**Key Components:**

- **Producer:** Sends messages to Kafka topics.
- **Broker:** Stores and distributes messages.
- **Consumer:** Reads messages from topics.
- **Zookeeper:** Manages metadata and leader election.

### **2. Why is Kafka technology significant to use?**

Kafka is widely used because of its **scalability, durability, and high throughput**.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Handles large-scale data efficiently** (millions of messages per second).
- **Real-time processing** (low latency).
- **Highly scalable & fault-tolerant** (distributes data across multiple nodes).
- **Decouples microservices** (makes communication asynchronous).

### **3. Is Apache Kafka a distributed streaming platform? If yes, what can you do with it?**

Yes, Apache Kafka is a **distributed streaming platform**.

**With Kafka, you can:**

- **Publish and subscribe** to streams of records.
- **Store messages durably** in a fault-tolerant way.
- **Process data in real-time** using Kafka Streams or other frameworks (Spark, Flink).
- **Integrate with various systems** using Kafka Connect.

### **4. What can you do with Kafka?**

Kafka is used for various purposes, including:

1. **Event-Driven Architectures** – Decouples services in microservices.
2. **Log Aggregation** – Centralizes application logs.
3. **Real-time Analytics** – Processes streaming data instantly.
4. **Monitoring Systems** – Collects logs and metrics from multiple sources.
5. **Messaging System** – Acts as a distributed message queue.
6. **ETL Pipelines** – Moves data efficiently across systems.

### **5. Explain Multi-Tenancy.**

Multi-tenancy is a **software architecture where a single instance of an application serves multiple tenants (users or organizations)** while keeping their data **logically isolated**.

**Types of Multi-Tenancy:**

1. **Database Level:** Separate databases for each tenant.
2. **Schema Level:** Shared database but different schemas.
3. **Table Level:** Shared tables with tenant-specific filters.

**Examples:**

- Cloud platforms like AWS, Salesforce, or VYMO use multi-tenancy to serve multiple customers on a shared infrastructure.
