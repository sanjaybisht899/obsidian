### **6. Enlist the Several Components in Kafka**

- **Topic:** A category or feed name where records are published.
- **Producer:** Publishes messages to topics.
- **Consumer:** Subscribes to topics and reads messages.
- **Broker:** A server that stores messages and handles read/write requests.
- **ZooKeeper:** (Traditionally) used for coordination, leader election, and cluster metadata management.

---

### **7. Explain the Role of the Offset**

- **Offset:** A unique sequential ID assigned to each message within a partition.
- **Purpose:** Identifies each message's position, allowing consumers to track and resume processing from a specific point.

---

### **8. What is a Consumer Group?**

- **Consumer Group:** A collection of consumers that work together to consume messages from one or more topics.
- **Key Point:** Within a group, each message is delivered to only one consumer, enabling load balancing and parallel processing.

---

### **9. What is the Role of ZooKeeper in Kafka?**

- **ZooKeeper:** A centralized coordination service used to manage and synchronize the Kafka cluster.
- **Functions:** Tracks broker metadata, coordinates leader election, and stores configuration and offset data.

---

### **10. Is It Possible to Use Kafka Without ZooKeeper?**

- **Traditional Kafka:** Requires ZooKeeper for cluster management.
- **Modern Approach:** Newer Kafka versions (using KRaft mode) aim to remove the dependency on ZooKeeper, but in many deployments ZooKeeper is still used.

---

### **11. What Do You Know About Partition in Kafka?**

- **Partition:** A division of a topic’s log; each partition is an ordered, immutable sequence of records.
- **Benefits:** Enables parallel processing, scalability, and fault tolerance by distributing data across brokers.

---

### **12. Explain the Concept of Leader and Follower**

- **Leader:** The broker that handles all read and write operations for a partition.
- **Follower:** One or more brokers that replicate the leader’s data; they ensure high availability and take over if the leader fails.

---

### **13. What Ensures Load Balancing of the Server in Kafka?**

- **Partitioning:** Distributes data across multiple brokers.
- **Consumer Groups:** Spread the consumption load among multiple consumers.
- **Together:** These mechanisms balance both data storage and processing workload.

---

### **14. What Roles Do Replicas and the ISR Play?**

- **Replicas:** Copies of a partition’s data stored on multiple brokers.
- **ISR (In-Sync Replicas):** This is the **group of follower replicas** that are **fully up-to-date** with the leader.
	- If a follower is **too slow** or **fails**, it gets removed from the ISR.
	- Only ISR members can be promoted to leader if the current leader fails.
	- **Kafka's Controller Broker** is responsible for monitoring replicas.

---

### **15. Why Are Replications Critical in Kafka?**

- **Replication:** Prevents data loss by ensuring that messages have multiple copies.
- **Benefits:** Provides high availability and fault tolerance; if a broker fails, another replica can serve the data.

---

### **16. If a Replica Stays Out of the ISR for a Long Time, What Does It Signify?**

- **Implication:** The replica is lagging behind the leader, likely due to performance or connectivity issues.
- **Result:** It might be removed from the ISR to maintain the integrity and consistency of the cluster.

---

### **17. What Does ISR Stand for in a Kafka Environment?**

- **ISR:** Stands for **In-Sync Replicas**—the set of replicas that are fully synchronized with the leader.

---

### **18. What is Geo-Replication in Kafka?**

- **Geo-Replication:** The process of replicating Kafka data across different geographic regions or data centers.
- **Purpose:** Enhances data locality, disaster recovery, and supports multi-region deployments.
- **Tool:** Often implemented using **MirrorMaker**.

---

### **19. Explain the Term “Log Anatomy”**

- **Log Anatomy:** Refers to the structure of a Kafka log.
- **Details:** It is an **append-only** sequence of records, divided into **partitions**, with each record assigned a unique offset.
- **Purpose:** This structure enables ordered, fault-tolerant, and efficient data storage and retrieval.

---

### **20. What is Data Log in Kafka?**

- **Data Log:** The persistent, ordered record of messages within a partition.
- **Key Points:**
    - Messages are stored for a configured retention period.
    - Consumers can read messages from any point in the log (using offsets).

---

### **21. Explain the Term “Topic Replication Factor”**

- **Topic Replication Factor:** The number of copies of each partition that Kafka maintains across different brokers.
- **Purpose:** Ensures **fault tolerance** and **high availability**; if one broker fails, other replicas can serve the data.
