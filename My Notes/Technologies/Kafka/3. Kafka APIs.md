### **22. What are the main APIs of Kafka?**

Kafka provides **five main APIs** to interact with data:

1. **Producer API** â€“ Sends (produces) messages to topics.
2. **Consumer API** â€“ Reads (consumes) messages from topics.
3. **Streams API** â€“ Processes data in real-time.
4. **Connector API** â€“ Integrates Kafka with external systems like databases.
5. **Admin API** â€“ Manages topics, brokers, configurations, etc.

### **23. Explain the role of the Kafka Producer API.**

- The **Producer API** is responsible for **sending data** (messages) to Kafka topics.
- It allows applications to publish records to **specific topics**.
- Producers decide which partition a message should go to, either **randomly** or **based on a key**

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A banking systemâ€™s **Producer API** sends transaction records to a Kafka topic named `bank-transactions`.

---

### **24. What is the role of the Consumer API?**

- The **Consumer API** allows applications to **read data** from Kafka topics.
- It tracks **offsets** to ensure messages are processed **only once**.
- Consumers can belong to **consumer groups** for load balancing.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A **fraud detection system** uses the Consumer API to read transaction data and detect anomalies.

---

### **25. Explain the role of the Streams API.**

- The **Streams API** enables **real-time data processing**(processing messages) in Kafka.
- It allows applications to transform, filter, aggregate, or join streams.
- It processes data **directly from topics** and **writes the results back to Kafka**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A retail company uses the Streams API to **calculate real-time sales trends** from orders.

---

### **26. What is the role of the Connector API?**

- The **Connector API** helps integrate Kafka with **external systems** like databases, cloud services, and storage solutions.
- It uses **pre-built connectors** to simplify data movement.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A company uses a **JDBC Kafka Connector** to sync data between Kafka and MySQL.

---

### **27. Explain Producer.**

- A **Producer** is an application that **sends messages** to Kafka topics.
- It decides **which partition** to write the message to.
- It ensures **delivery guarantees**, such as **at-most-once, at-least-once, and exactly-once**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A weather service **producer** sends temperature data to a Kafka topic every second.

---

### **28. What are consumers or users?**

- **Consumers** are applications that **read messages** from Kafka topics.
- They belong to **consumer groups**, allowing **load balancing** of message processing.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A news aggregator app reads headlines from a **Kafka topic** and displays them to users.
