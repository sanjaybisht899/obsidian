### **4. Apache Kafka Use Cases**

Kafka is widely used for **real-time data streaming** and **message brokering** in various industries. Some common use cases include:

- **Real-time Analytics** â€“ Processing high-volume event data from applications, IoT devices, or logs.
- **Event-Driven Architectures** â€“ Microservices communicating asynchronously.
- **Log Aggregation** â€“ Collecting and analyzing logs in real time.
- **Metrics Collection & Monitoring** â€“ Storing and processing application metrics (e.g., Prometheus).
- **Fraud Detection** â€“ Real-time transaction monitoring in banking.
- **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Data ingestion, transformation, and loading for big data systems.

### **8. What is Stream Processing in Kafka?**

Stream processing in Kafka means **processing real-time data as it flows through Kafka topics**.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A retail app **reads orders** from a Kafka topic, **applies discounts** dynamically, and **stores updated prices** in another topicâ€”all in real-time!

Stream processing helps in:  
âœ… **Transforming** raw data into meaningful insights.  
âœ… **Filtering** unwanted data before it reaches storage.  
âœ… **Enriching** data by joining multiple streams.
