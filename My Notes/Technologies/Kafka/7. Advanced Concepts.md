### **18. Types of Traditional Methods of Message Transfer**

Before Kafka, traditional message transfer methods included:

1. **Point-to-Point Messaging (P2P) (ActiveMQ, JMS)**
    
    - Messages are sent **directly to a single receiver**.
    - Once consumed, they are **removed from the queue**.
    - Good for **synchronous** communication.
2. **Publish-Subscribe (Pub-Sub) (RabbitMQ, MQTT)**
    
    - Messages are **broadcast** to multiple subscribers.
    - Subscribers consume messages **independently**.
    - Good for **event-driven** systems.
3. **Batch Processing (ETL Tools like Hadoop, Spark)**
    
    - Data is collected, processed, and transferred in **batches**.
    - Slower, but useful for **large-scale** processing.
4. **Database Polling**
    
    - Applications **query a database periodically** for new data.
    - Inefficient, as it creates **high load** on the database.

ðŸš€ **Kafka solves these issues** by combining Pub-Sub + Queuing, offering **scalability, durability, and real-time streaming**.

### **19. Importance of Java in Apache Kafka**

Kafka is **written in Java and Scala**, making Java a key language for:

âœ… **Kafka Clients:** Java is the most widely used language for Kafka producers, consumers, and stream processing.  
âœ… **Performance Optimization:** Java provides **high throughput** and **low latency**.  
âœ… **Integration:** Java-based frameworks (Spring Boot, Spark, Flink) integrate **seamlessly** with Kafka.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
A **Java Spring Boot** application can use **Kafka Consumer API** to process real-time transactions.

### **20. Best Feature of Kafka**

ðŸ”¥ **Scalability** â€“ Kafka handles **millions of messages per second** by adding brokers **without downtime**.
