### **21. Disadvantages of Apache Kafka**

While Kafka is powerful, it has some limitations:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Complex Setup & Maintenance**

- Requires **ZooKeeper**, multiple brokers, and careful tuning.
- Not beginner-friendly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **High Latency for Small Messages**

- Best suited for **high-throughput** workloads.
- Not ideal for real-time **low-latency** systems (e.g., financial transactions).

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Message Ordering is Per-Partition, Not Global**

- Messages are ordered **within a partition**, but **not across partitions**.
- This can cause problems in **strictly ordered event processing**.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **No Built-in Message Processing**

- Unlike RabbitMQ, Kafka does **not support message transformation**.
- Needs **Kafka Streams or external processing** (e.g., Spark, Flink).

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Not an Ideal Replacement for Databases**

- Kafka **retains messages for a limited time** (based on retention policy).
- It does **not support queries** like a traditional database.

üìå **Example:**  
If you need a **lightweight messaging system with guaranteed message delivery**, **RabbitMQ** might be a better choice.
