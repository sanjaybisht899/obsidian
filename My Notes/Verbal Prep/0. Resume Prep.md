### **Implementing Internationalization (i18n) in Showman: A Journey of Problem-Solving**

At Vymo, one of the major challenges we faced was ensuring a seamless experience for our diverse client base, spanning multiple geographies and industries. While our mobile application already had i18n support, the demo data used by our pre-sales team lacked localization, making it difficult to showcase a truly localized product experience to potential clients.

To bridge this gap, I took the initiative to develop **Showman**, an internal tool built using **React**, designed to generate and push structured lead data dynamically. This tool became a game-changer for our pre-sales team, enabling them to present data tailored to different geographies and industries such as **banks, insurance firms, and agencies**. However, implementing i18n support within Showman came with its own set of technical and architectural challenges.

---

### **The Core Problem: Non-Localized Demo Data**

The pre-sales team needed data that reflected real-world business scenarios for different clients. Previously, they had to **manually create demo data**, which was a slow and error-prone process. Moreover, since the existing system lacked **dynamic localization support**, data was often mismatched with the client’s locale, leading to an inconsistent user experience during demos.

For instance, if a sales demo was being conducted for a **client in Japan**, but the lead names, addresses, and business terminologies were in **English**, it would feel unnatural. Similarly, clients in **Mumbai** expected local addresses, phone number formats, and regional terminologies.

---

### **Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented**

#### **1. Handling Locale-Specific Data Generation**

**Problem:** The biggest challenge was ensuring that the generated data was relevant to the selected locale. A simple translation wouldn’t work; we needed real-world data that aligned with the geography.

**Solution:** I implemented a **locale-based data generation system**, where users could select a region (e.g., Mumbai, Tokyo, New York), and the tool would:

- Fetch **region-specific lead names**, business names, and contact details.
- Automatically **adjust date formats**, currency, and address structures based on the locale.
- Support **proximity-based filtering**, allowing users to specify a target area and generate data accordingly.

---

#### **2. Managing Large-Scale API Calls Efficiently**

**Problem:** Since the tool had to fetch data dynamically for multiple clients across different industries, we had to make multiple API calls, leading to performance bottlenecks.

**Solution:** To optimize this, I:

- **Implemented caching mechanisms** to store frequently used data, reducing redundant API calls.
- Used **batch processing** to minimize the number of requests being made at once.
- Introduced **asynchronous API handling** to prevent UI lag and ensure a smooth user experience.

---

#### **3. Supporting Multiple Data Structures Based on Industry**

**Problem:** Different industries had different requirements. A **banking client** needed financial transaction records, while an **insurance client** needed policy details. The challenge was to dynamically structure the data based on the client’s industry.

**Solution:** I designed a **flexible schema system** where:

- The user could select the industry, and Showman would **automatically structure the data accordingly**.
- Data templates were pre-defined for each industry but could also be customized dynamically.
- This ensured that banks received bank-related data, insurance companies received policyholder information, and so on.

---

#### **4. Integrating React for a Seamless User Experience**

Since the internal tool was built in **React**, one of my goals was to ensure a smooth and intuitive UI.

- Implemented a **dropdown-based locale selection**, making it easy for users to switch between different regions.
- Used **React Query** for efficient state management and data fetching.
- Added **real-time validation** to ensure that the generated data matched the selected locale and industry standards.

---

### **Final Impact & Business Value**

- **80% Reduction in Manual Work** – The pre-sales team no longer had to create demo data manually, saving them hours of effort.
- **Increased Sales Conversion** – By showcasing highly relevant, localized data, clients could better relate to the product, leading to improved engagement.
- **Scalability & Reusability** – The tool was designed to be easily extendable, allowing support for more regions and industries in the future.

---

### **Conclusion**

Implementing i18n support in Showman was not just about translating text; it was about creating a truly localized experience. By solving key challenges such as **dynamic locale-based data generation, optimizing API calls, and handling industry-specific structures**, we were able to enhance Vymo’s sales demos, making them more impactful and engaging for potential clients worldwide.

Developed a call analysis feature using OpenAI (Spring Boot) to predict next best actions for leads, utilizing Kafka for high-volume processing.

### **Building AI-Driven Call Analysis for Next-Best Action Predictions**

	Every year, Forrester hosts a major event where top sales tech companies showcase their innovations. Our team saw this as the perfect opportunity to present a **cutting-edge AI-powered call analysis feature** that could significantly enhance our existing **suggestion service**.

At Vymo, we already had a **lead suggestion service** that analyzed past lead data and provided recommendations for sales teams. However, we wanted to **elevate** this system by incorporating **real-time call insights**, ensuring that sales reps could get actionable recommendations **based on their live interactions with leads**.

---

### **The Challenge: Bringing AI into Call Analysis**

Our goal was ambitious:

1. Capture and process **real-time call data**.
2. Extract meaningful **insights from conversations**.
3. Provide **instant suggestions** to sales reps based on the call’s context.
4. Handle **high-volume traffic** without system slowdowns.

---

### **Step 1: Call Capture & Transcription**

To analyze calls, we needed to **record** them first. Direct phone calls wouldn’t allow recording, so we integrated **Nexotel** to facilitate call tracking and capture audio recordings.

Once calls were recorded, the next challenge was **processing and transcribing** them. We leveraged:

- **Amazon S3** for storing audio files securely.
- **AWS Transcribe / Google Speech-to-Text APIs** to convert the call recordings into transcripts.

This gave us a structured dataset that we could feed into our AI system for further analysis.

---

### **Step 2: Processing Call Data with OpenAI**

With transcripts in hand, we needed to **extract insights** and **predict the next best actions** based on the conversation. We sent both:

1. **Lead’s historical data**
2. **Call transcript**

…to **OpenAI** for intelligent analysis.

We implemented several **fine-tuned parameters** in OpenAI’s API to ensure high accuracy:

- **Temperature Control**: Adjusted manually to control response randomness.
- **Custom Mapping**: Defined strict parameters for mapping lead context to OpenAI’s responses.
- **Strictness Enforcement**: Used API constraints to maintain accuracy and prevent irrelevant suggestions.

The AI then **generated structured JSON responses**, which contained **actionable insights**—whether to send a document, schedule a follow-up, or transition the lead’s status based on their sentiment.

---

### **Step 3: Real-Time Suggestion Delivery via Kafka**

Our suggestion service needed to handle **thousands of real-time suggestions** coming from AI processing. However, the high volume of requests started causing delays, leading to **latency issues** when sales reps accessed suggestions.

#### **Solution: Kafka for High-Throughput Processing**

To eliminate bottlenecks, we integrated **Kafka** to:

- **Queue and process messages asynchronously** without overloading our system.
- **Ensure real-time suggestion delivery**, even under heavy loads.
- **Handle multiple concurrent requests** for different clients simultaneously.

With Kafka, our system became **highly scalable and responsive**, ensuring **instant AI-driven recommendations** without any lag.

---

### **Final Impact**

- **Enabled real-time, AI-powered call insights**, improving sales decision-making.
- **Reduced response latency** with Kafka, handling **high volumes efficiently**.
- **Automated next-best action predictions**, improving lead conversion rates.
- **Secured multiple clients** by demonstrating this innovation at Forrester.

This project not only improved our product but also helped Vymo **stand out in the competitive sales-tech industry**, reinforcing our leadership in AI-driven sales automation.
