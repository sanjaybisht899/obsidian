Why do you want to leave your current company?

There are actually multiple reasons why I’m looking for a change. The main one is that my work has become repetitive, and I feel like I’m not using my full potential. I enjoy learning new things and taking on new challenges, but that’s not happening in my current role. This has affected my motivation.

Another reason is that many of the people I worked closely with have already left, which has changed the work environment. But the biggest reason is my growth—I want to work on new technologies and gain more experience. I believe Oracle is the right place for that, as it offers exciting projects and a great learning environment.
