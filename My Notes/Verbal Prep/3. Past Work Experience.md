##  Give an example of a time you had to make a difficult decision. How did you approach it?

Here’s your answer **refined into clear, concise points** using the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)** for better structure and impact:

---

### **Situation:**
- A potential client requested a **custom functionality** in Vymo that wasn’t yet built.  
- The request came through the **sales and product teams**, and the client needed it **urgently** for a demo.  
- We faced a dilemma:  
  - **Option 1:** Build the feature quickly under a tight deadline, risking potential bugs.  
  - **Option 2:** Deliver a minimal version, which could lead to losing the client.  

---

### **Task:**
- I had to decide how to **balance urgency and quality** while ensuring client satisfaction and avoiding revenue loss.  

---

### **Action:**
1. **Analyzed the Request:**  
   - Understood the client’s requirements and the **scope of the feature**.  
   - Estimated the time and effort needed to build the feature properly.  

2. **Identified Dependencies:**  
   - Checked for **technical dependencies** and potential challenges in implementing the feature.  

3. **Discussed with Stakeholders:**  
   - Initiated conversations with the **pre-sales and product teams** to align on priorities.  
   - Presented the team’s analysis, including:  
     - The **minimal viable product (MVP)** we could deliver quickly.  
     - The **full feature set** that would require more time.  

4. **Made the Decision:**  
   - Decided to **deliver an MVP** within the tight deadline to meet the client’s immediate needs.  
   - Planned to **fully build the feature** in later iterations.  

5. **Executed the Plan:**  
   - Worked with the team to deliver the **MVP on time**, ensuring it was **bug-free and functional**.  
   - Rolled out the **full feature set** in subsequent updates.  

---

### **Result:**
- Delivered the **MVP on time**, satisfying the client’s immediate needs and avoiding revenue loss.  
- Completed the **full feature set** in later iterations, showcasing Vymo’s commitment to continuous improvement.  
- The client was **satisfied**, and the pre-sales team successfully closed the deal.  

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Balanced Priorities:** Learned to balance **urgency and quality** while meeting client expectations.  
- **Effective Communication:** Collaborated with cross-functional teams to align on goals and timelines.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Delivered a solution that addressed both short-term and long-term needs.
