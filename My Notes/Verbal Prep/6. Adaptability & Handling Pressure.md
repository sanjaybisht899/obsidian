Here’s a **structured approach** to answering these questions, focusing on **adaptability and handling pressure**. I’ll provide **tips, key points, and examples** for each question to help you craft clear and impactful responses:

---

### **1. Tell me about a time when things did not go as planned. How did you handle it?**
- **Focus on:** Problem-solving, adaptability, and staying calm under pressure.  
- **Structure (STAR Method):**  
  - **Situation:** Describe the situation and what went wrong.  
  - **Task:** Explain your role and the challenge you faced.  
  - **Action:** Share how you adapted and resolved the issue.  
  - **Result:** Highlight the outcome and what you learned.  
- **Key Points to Include:**  
  - The **unexpected issue** (e.g., a bug, missed deadline, or change in requirements).  
  - How you **stayed calm and assessed the situation**.  
  - Steps you took to **resolve the issue** (e.g., debugging, re-prioritizing tasks, or collaborating with others).  
  - The **positive outcome** (e.g., meeting the deadline, satisfying the client, or learning a new skill).  
  - What you learned about **handling unexpected challenges**.  

Here’s a **refined and structured version** of your answer using the **STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)**. I’ve made it more concise, professional, and impactful while keeping the core idea intact:

---

### **Situation:**
- Just before a **critical demo**, the pre-sales team reported a **major bug** in the system.  
- The issue was related to a **cron job** not triggering, which caused the user portal to fail in suggesting action items to users.  

---

### **Task:**
- My goal was to **resolve the bug quickly** to ensure the demo went smoothly without any hiccups.  

---

### **Action:**
1. **Reprioritized Tasks:**  
   - After discussing with my manager, we reprioritized our work to focus on the bug, as the **severity of the demo was higher** than other tasks.  

2. **Identified the Root Cause:**  
   - Investigated the issue and found that a **condition in the code** was not being met, preventing the cron job from triggering.  

3. **Collaborated with the Team:**  
   - Initiated a conversation with the developer responsible for the microservice to understand the issue better.  
   - Realized that fixing the code would take too much time, so we decided to **manually trigger the cron jobs** as a temporary solution.  

4. **Executed the Workaround:**  
   - Set up a call with the team during the demo to **manually trigger the required services** in real-time.  
   - Guided the pre-sales team on when to trigger each cron job to ensure the demo ran smoothly.  

5. **Prevented Future Issues:**  
   - After the demo, conducted a **root cause analysis (RCA)** to identify why the cron job failed.  
   - Updated the **test cases** to cover this scenario and prevent similar issues in the future.  

---

### **Result:**
- The **demo was successful**, and the client was satisfied with the product.  
- The **temporary workaround** ensured there were no disruptions during the demo.  
- The **root cause was identified and fixed**, and test cases were updated to prevent recurrence.  

---

### **Key Takeaways:**
- **Adaptability:** I learned to quickly adapt to unexpected challenges and find temporary solutions under pressure.  
- **Collaboration:** Working closely with the team and pre-sales ensured a smooth demo.  
- **Problem-Solving:** Identifying the root cause and updating test cases helped prevent future issues.  

---

### **Why This Works:**
- It demonstrates your ability to **handle pressure and think on your feet**.  
- It highlights your **problem-solving, collaboration, and communication skills**.  
- It shows your focus on **delivering results** while ensuring long-term improvements.

### **Additional Tips:**
1. **Be Concise:** Avoid over-explaining technical details. Focus on the key actions and outcomes.  
2. **Highlight Teamwork:** Emphasize how you collaborated with others to resolve the issue.  
3. **End Positively:** Conclude with the successful outcome and what you learned.

### **2. Have you ever had to learn a new skill or technology quickly? How did you do it?**
- **Focus on:** Learning agility, resourcefulness, and adaptability.  
- **Structure (STAR Method):**  
  - **Situation:** Describe the situation that required you to learn something new.  
  - **Task:** Explain why the skill or technology was important and the timeline for learning it.  
  - **Action:** Share how you approached learning (e.g., online courses, documentation, or mentorship).  
  - **Result:** Highlight how you applied the new skill and the impact it had.  
- **Key Points to Include:**  
  - The **skill or technology** you had to learn (e.g., Docker, Kafka, or a new programming language).  
  - How you **prioritized learning** while managing other responsibilities.  
  - Resources you used (e.g., tutorials, forums, or team members).  
  - How you **applied the new skill** to solve a problem or complete a task.  
  - What you learned about **quick learning and adaptability**.

### **3. How do you handle sudden changes in priorities or last-minute requests?**
- **Focus on:** Flexibility, time management, and staying organized.  
- **Structure (STAR Method):**  
  - **Situation:** Describe a situation where priorities changed or a last-minute request came in.  
  - **Task:** Explain the challenge and your role in addressing it.  
  - **Action:** Share how you managed the change (e.g., re-prioritizing tasks, communicating with stakeholders, or working extra hours).  
  - **Result:** Highlight the outcome and how you ensured success.  
- **Key Points to Include:**  
  - The **change or request** (e.g., a new feature request, a bug fix, or a shift in project goals).  
  - How you **assessed the impact** of the change on your workload and timeline.  
  - Steps you took to **adapt** (e.g., re-organizing tasks, delegating, or seeking help).  
  - How you **communicated** with stakeholders to manage expectations.  
  - The **positive outcome** (e.g., meeting the new deadline, satisfying the client, or maintaining team morale).  
  - What you learned about **handling changes and pressure**.
