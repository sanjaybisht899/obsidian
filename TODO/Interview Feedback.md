# **Introduction**


Hi, my name is V. Soni. I have around 4.5 years of experience working as a backend engineer, focusing on building scalable and efficient systems that drive impact. Currently, I’m working at C2FO as a Software Development Engineer in the Buyer Experience Tech team, where I’m responsible for ensuring a seamless experience for buyers. Over the past two years, I’ve contributed to designing and developing new features, participating in design discussions, conducting code reviews, and mentoring junior engineers.

In one of my projects, I collaboratively worked with my team to develop a product that led to a $1 million revenue growth. Prior to C2FO, I worked at FAET in the publishing team, where I was responsible for preparing performance reports for the company. There, I contributed to multiple key features that increased user efficiency. In one project, I designed an API interface for book generation, which led to a $120k revenue growth.

Outside of work, I enjoy collaborating with teams to solve complex problems, mentoring junior engineers, working out at the gym, spending time with my family, playing video games, and practicing meditation to stay focused and balanced.

### **Question 1: What motivates you to stay motivated every day?**
For me, motivation comes from solving problems that have a direct impact on users or contribute to my personal growth. For example, if I’m working on a feature that improves user experience or doing something that brings me happiness, like working out or spending time with my family, it keeps me motivated. Additionally, working with talented individuals and learning from them also drives me. These two aspects—impacting users and personal growth—are my primary sources of motivation.

---

### **Question 2: Can you describe a challenging project you’ve worked on?**
In my current role at C2FO, I worked on a project where the existing solution for generating working capital reports for buyers was manual, error-prone, and not scalable. It took around 3-4 weeks to generate a single report, which was inefficient. Our leadership team decided to build a platform to help buyers visualize insightful data and perform analysis at geographic, industry, and category levels for suppliers. Admins could also upload large datasets through this platform.

I was part of the backend team responsible for designing and developing this solution. The key challenges included:
1. Building a distributed system across multiple regions to comply with GDPR.
2. Handling financial data securely.
3. Ingesting large files efficiently.
4. Ensuring high reliability, scalability, and performance.

To address these challenges, I designed a distributed microservice architecture using PostgreSQL as the database, RabbitMQ for asynchronous processing, and cloud storage (AWS S3 and GCP GCS) for GDPR compliance. I also created an API layer for frontend consumption and a file upload system for admins.

After gathering requirements, I broke down the tasks into logical components, collaborated with the frontend and data engineering teams, and mentored junior engineers on distributed system concepts. We successfully launched the Navigator application, which:
1. Reduced report generation time from 3-4 weeks to 2-3 hours.
2. Secured 7-8 new client deals, leading to $1 million in revenue growth.
3. Improved data accuracy by 99%.
4. Enabled operation analysts to analyze three times more suppliers due to time savings.

On a personal level, this project enhanced my leadership, time management, and mentorship skills, while also deepening my understanding of system design.

---

### **Question 3: Have you ever faced a conflict or difference of opinion with a colleague or team? How did you handle it?**
In one instance, while working on the buyer application, I had to implement role-based access control for filters across multiple screens. Initially, I made changes directly to the market filter context, which powered the entire application. During the code review, a colleague suggested creating a hook layer over the context instead of modifying it directly.

At first, I disagreed because I believed there were multiple ways to achieve the same result. However, after discussing it further, I realized that creating a hook layer would simplify the code and mitigate risks to the entire application. I incorporated the feedback, and the solution worked well. This experience taught me the importance of considering different perspectives and prioritizing user impact.

---

### **Question 4: How do you work in a collaborative environment?**
In collaborative projects, I follow a structured approach:
1. **Task Breakdown**: I break down the project into logical components and subtasks.
2. **Team Collaboration**: I assign tasks to team members based on their expertise and ensure clear communication.
3. **Development**: I work on independent tasks and collaborate on dependent ones, ensuring regular code reviews and feedback.
4. **Testing and Deployment**: Once development is complete, I move changes to UAT, perform testing, and deploy to production.

For example, in the Navigator project, I collaborated with frontend engineers, data engineers, and junior backend engineers. I mentored junior team members, conducted code reviews, and ensured alignment with the overall architecture.

---

### **Question 5: How would you handle a difficult client or stakeholder?**
While I haven’t directly interacted with clients, if I were to handle a difficult stakeholder, I would:
1. **Listen and Understand**: Gather all requirements and ask clarifying questions to understand their expectations.
2. **Communicate**: Share the requirements with my manager and product manager for feasibility checks.
3. **Propose Solutions**: Prepare a detailed design document and propose solutions that align with their needs.
4. **Collaborate**: Work with the team to implement the solution, ensuring regular updates and feedback loops.

---

### **Question 6: What are your short-term and long-term career goals?**
**Short-term Goals**:
1. Switch to a company where I can contribute to impactful projects.
2. Focus on personal growth, such as improving my fitness and buying a new car.

**Long-term Goals**:
1. Continuously learn new technologies and solve complex problems with real user impact.
2. Grow as an engineer, eventually moving into senior and leadership roles.
3. Achieve financial independence and buy a new house.

Beyond work, maintaining a healthy work-life balance and spending time with my family are always priorities.
